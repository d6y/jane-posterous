I spotted a really interesting article in yesterday's <a href="http://money.guardian.co.uk/workweekly/0,,,00.html">Guardian Work</a> section, <a href="http://money.guardian.co.uk/workweekly/story/0,,2041153,00.html">Snap Decision</a>.  It is about <a href="http://www.kirwin.tv/index2.php">Alan Kirwin</a>, a one time computing professional, who quit his day job and went on to become a successful wedding photographer with an interesting take on the wedding format - following a couple through from engagement, hen and stag parties, the wedding itself and even onto the honeymoon.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-2202517636098875900?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
