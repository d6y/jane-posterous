<p>A quick <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/tag/nvq">NVQ</a> update:<p />Yesterday I met with my assessor for the first time this year, and we reviewed my progress.  It looks like I'm very close to having everything in place for my first 2 units - <a href="http://www.management-standards.org/content_1.aspx?id=10:2281&amp;id=10:2075&amp;id=10:2012&amp;id=10:1917">D1</a> and <a href="http://www.management-standards.org/content_1.aspx?id=10:2286&amp;id=10:2075&amp;id=10:2012&amp;id=10:1917">D6</a>. My evidence for both of these units is now with the assessor to catalogue and cross reference and bring back for me to append any notes and signatures that she thinks the Internal Verifier will want to see.  That leaves me with 5 to go, and a target date of August which feels a bit on the ambitious side.  <p />Next up is <a href="http://www.management-standards.org/content_1.aspx?id=10:2255&amp;id=10:2072&amp;id=10:2012&amp;id=10:1917">Unit A2: Manage your own resources and professional development</a> and I have quite a lot of evidence, personal statements and the like to produce before my next meeting on the 18th February so the pace has definitely just been upped.</p>
