<p>On Saturday I attended the 6th of the <a href="http://www.developerday.co.uk/ddd/default.asp">DDD day</a>s held at Microsoft campus in Reading.  This was my first DDD, although I have attended a <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/webdd-overview">WebDD</a> and the recent <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/sqlbits-conference">SQLBits</a> day this year.<p />The day was again broken into <a href="http://www.developerday.co.uk/ddd/agendaddd6lineup.asp">5 sessions, with 4 streams</a>.  The sessions I attended were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://quickstarts.asp.net/Futures/dynamicdatacontrols/default.aspx">ASP.NET Dynamic Data Controls</a> with <a href="http://blogs.ipona.com/davids/">Dave Sussman</a></li>
<li><a href="http://dotnetworkaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/continuous_integration_ddd6.zip">Cruise Control.NET</a> (retitled in the presentation as Continuous Integration) with <a href="http://www.dotnetworkaholic.com/">Paul Lockwood</a></li>
<li>Microsoft Codename "<a href="http://astoria.mslivelabs.com/gettingStarted.aspx">Astoria</a>" with <a href="http://www.guysmithferrier.com/">Guy Smith-Ferrier</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.blackmarble.co.uk/ConferencePapers/DDD6%20Presentation%20-%20An%20Introduction%20to%20Scrum.ppt">What is Scrum?</a> with <a href="https://blogs.blackmarble.co.uk/blogs/rfennell">Richard Fennell</a></li>
<li>Swaggily Fortunes with Richard Costall and <a href="http://nxtgenug.spaces.live.com/blog/">Dave McMahon</a></li>
</ul>
<p><br />I was pleased with my session choice and gained lots from all the speakers.  I combined some talks that I knew aspects about (like the Continuous Integration one) with those that I'd not come across before (ASP.NET dynamic data controls - which look really handy for admin sites etc, and Astoria).  I had to do a swift session swap for session 3 as I'd sat myself down ready to learn about Business apps with WPF with <a href="http://www.sturmnet.org/blog/">Oliver Sturm</a> when he mentioned it was part 2 and I'd <a href="http://www.sturmnet.org/blog/archives/2007/11/22/my-ddd-double-session-not-a-repetition/">misread the agenda</a>.  Still, I got to learn about astoria which was really interesting and sounds really useful.  My final session of the day was silly yet fun as Dave and Richard led a mass schwag giveaway hosting a game of "A question of swag" followed by a game of "Swaggity Swag".<p />The schwag bag wasn't great, consisting of just a pen - not even a notebook this time - but the <a href="http://www.innerworkings.com/promotions/120/ddd-offer">hour of free training</a> that <a href="http://www.innerworkings.com/">innerworkings</a> provided is a great gift to come away with.<p />All in all, another great developer conference and an opportunity to catch up with some familiar faces from the previous days.</p>
