<p>In my <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/dconstruct-2010">dConstruct post</a> the other day, I said</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #444444; line-height: 18px;"><strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><a href="http://shorttermmemoryloss.com/" style="color: #0080c3; text-decoration: none; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">James Bridle</a></strong>&nbsp;was the highlight for me I think. He spoke about the history of the internet, not how it started, but how data evolved. He talked about GeoCities, and how much of that information is lost, the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.archive.org/web/web.php" style="color: #0080c3; text-decoration: none; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">internet archive wayback machine</a>&nbsp;has some of it, but not all. The whole of the internet archive fits into a shipping container. It's a special Sun data center one but it's still a shipping container. He taught me about&nbsp;<a href="http://webtrends.about.com/od/wiki/a/wiki_game.htm" style="color: #0080c3; text-decoration: none; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">wiki racing</a>&nbsp;and introduced me to&nbsp;<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wiki-hunt-the-wikipedia-game/id357626743?mt=8" style="color: #0080c3; text-decoration: none; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Wiki Hunt</a>&nbsp;which I think is a genius idea. And finally, he told us about the history of edits on wikipedia. He chose the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War" style="color: #0080c3; text-decoration: none; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Iraq War</a>&nbsp;page and collected every edit and revision ever made. And then printed it. It ended up being 12 volumes of fairly large books. Leafing through it, which Alex and I did during the break, shows trolling edits, and informative edits. Amazing and beautiful. Amazing to think that there are 12 volumes of history for one article, and yet as a child I remember having a set of encyclopaedia which were probably of a similar size, which were covering every subject in the world.</span></p>

<p>When reading <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/1691/">Jeremy's dConstruct review</a> I noticed he'd linked to James's own article&nbsp;<a href="http://booktwo.org/notebook/wikipedia-historiography/">On Wikipedia, Cultural Patrimony, and Historiography</a>, so I went off and took a look and&nbsp;I'd thoroughly recommend a read of it. &nbsp;It'll give you a far better insight into his talk, than my paragraph could. &nbsp;Or alternatively you could <a href="http://huffduffer.com/dConstruct/25256">listen to the audio</a>, whilst looking at the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/stml/james-bridle-dconstruct-2010">slides</a></p>
