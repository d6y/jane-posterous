We visited some friends for a lovely roast dinner yesterday and whilst we were there I did some technical support.  Since upgrading to IE7 Microsoft Live Messenger had stopped signing in saying there was a temporary service problem and displaying error code 80040111.  We tried logging on via <a href="http://wwwl.meebo.com/index-en.html">meebo.com</a> and that worked well.  After a bit of googling I discovered a two point plan.  Firstly, <a href="http://imunplugged.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!C747C5A87E9286E6!2180.entry">re-register msxml.dll</a>.  This resulted in a different error code - this indicated progress.  I googled for that code (can't remember what it was) and found a suggestion to remove Live Messenger, reinstall Live Messenger and reboot.  I did all that, and it all worked.  A fair exchange for a yummy dinner.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-116582971779975898?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
