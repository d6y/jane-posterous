After a couple of days on <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/blog/labels/bigtrip08.xml">our recent trip</a> I realized that my <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/labels/fe130.html">Olympus Fe-130</a> was just causing me frustration - it took 6 attempts one day to get it to start up :-(<p />Time for a replacement then. Annoyingly prior to our trip I had toyed with the idea but dismissed it as unnecessary - I didn't need a replacement secondary camera, the fe-130 would do just fine - and so didn't do much research. Consequently I headed into The Shutterbug in Woodburn Company Stores without a really clear idea of what I wanted. My criteria were:<br />1) cheap - up to $200<br />2) small and light - fit into my snowboarding trousers pocket<br />3) take either xd or SD cards - I have both with me<p />I explained what I was after and the first camera I was shown was an <a href="http://www.olympus.co.uk/consumer/mju_tough_special_site.htm">Olympus tough</a> which is water resistant and shock proof, takes xd cards and small - over budget at $300 though but this wasn't the real killer, after my experience with the Fe-130 I wasn't sure if I was ready to trust another Olympus yet.<p />We then moved on to the <a href="http://www.cameras.co.uk/reviews/nikon-coolpix-s500.cfm">Nikon Coolpix S500</a> which fitted all the criteria, has easy to use controls and has menus similar enough to the <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/labels/d80.html">D80</a> to not send me scrabbling for the manual every other minute.  Over the course of the trip, this proved to be reliable, have a good battery life and take a fairly decent snow based picture.<p /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<p />And yes I do remember that one of my <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/2007/11/tips-for-photography-skillsway-brighton.html">tips for photography</a> was to never buy a camera and use it for the first time on an important occasion, like a holiday, but the unreliability of the Fe-130 - at least in cold temperatures - gave me little option.<p />If you're interested in seeing some of the resulting photos, take a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/tags/s500">look here</a><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-593692409580891101?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
