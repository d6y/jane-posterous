I'm going to be attending <a href="http://www.wiselimited.com/index.htm">Wise Ltd</a>'s <a href="http://www.wiselimited.com/SQSAIS.htm">Advanced SQL Server Integration Services</a> training course in September.  Now admittedly by that point the current project will be live (fingers crossed), but hopefully I'll have a lot more knowledge for the design of the next one, rather than the trial and error approach that I've used this time.<p />Also our copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0672327813/202-4813432-1479055?v=glance&amp;n=266239&amp;v=glance/richarddallaway">Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Integration Services</a> arrived today.  I've only had a quick flick through so far but it looks far better than the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0764584359/ref=sr_11_1/202-5908120-8586210?ie=UTF8/richarddallaway">other one</a>.  Nice work <a href="http://sqljunkies.com/WebLog/knight_reign/">Kirk</a>.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-115592828681247220?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
