It was displayed on the 21st April at 3.17PM Central European Time.<p />It's a really nice idea, you upload your photo and then wait - 100 photos are chosen randomly every week, and when a new photo is displayed a photo is taken of it being projected and then emailed to the photographer.  It's just the kind of exhibition I can imagine happening at <a href="http://www.fabrica.org.uk/">fabrica</a>.<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-2066099259943178687?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
