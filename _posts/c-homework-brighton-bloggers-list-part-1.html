This evening I've been experimenting with some C# stuff at home.  The project I've set myself is to read an xml file into a grid, handle updates and write out both an xml file and a html sample which can then be fed into the <a href="http://www.brightonbloggers.com/blogs/">Brighton Bloggers list</a> page (at the moment it is updated by hand in HTML whenever there is a change).  I could have done the development in my usual home time tool choice of <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> and <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">mySQL</a>, but this seems to be a better way of furthering my C#/.NET knowledge.<p />Thus far I've created a sample XML file, and have got that being read into a datagrid (with help from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/vbcon/html/vbwlkWalkthroughAccessingXMLData.asp">MSDN</a>) and can make changes to the data and get it to be written (again with help from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfSystemDataDataSetClassWriteXmlTopic.asp">MSDN</a>).  I've also sorted the datagrid into alphabetical order (based on blog name).<p />Tasks remaining:<br />1) Write out an alphabetically ordered HTML list (using appropriate Brighton Bloggers styles) for all the active blogs in the list<br />2) Add a check to go off and verify all the blogs in the list, and ensure that a response is found<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-112240566109949025?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
