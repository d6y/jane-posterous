Ages ago Relly first mentioned the idea of doing a <a href="http://trashthedress.com/">Trash the Dress</a> photo shoot.  For one reason or another it didn't happen then, but finally we got around to it, and I have to say it was great fun.  Relly was an excellent model, full of great movement, ideas and style.  We'd come up with a set of ideas before hand, mainly based around the props that a town like Brighton has to offer, the pier, the seafront, the sea and so off we headed getting some <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/janed/2754006147/in/set-72157606677279531/">bemused, confused and later congratulatory comments and actions</a>.<p /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<p />We started off at the graffiti wall outside the ClearLeft offices before heading onto the pier for a set of photos around the amusements, the gypsy caravan and of course eating chips.  <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jhedley/sets/72157606711759277/">Jim Hedley</a> joined us here.  <p /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<p />Next stop was the sea front and some photos with the carousel horses, before heading to a stall for ice cream and candy floss.<p /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<p />The final set was in the sea itself, and Relly was a great sport getting pretty wet, and no doubt fairly cold.<p />My full list of ideas for Brighton based Trash the Dress shots were:<ul><li>On the dodgem cars on the pier</li><li>In the amusements on the pier</li><li>At one of the fast food stalls on the pier - chips? doughnuts?</li><li>Near the green donut thing</li><li>On the trampoline bungy thing on the sea front</li><li>On the carousel</li><li>With an ice cream</li><li>With a stick of Brighton rock?</li><li>In one of the boats near the fishing museum</li><li>At the fish/jellied eel stall near the fishing museum</li><li>Standing at the edge of the sea</li><li>Standing in the sea, pier backdrop</li></ul>Of which we managed probably around 80% - some which worked, some which didn't, but none the less a great experience.<p />Take a look at the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157606707473436/">full collection here</a><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-5152125444789400258?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
