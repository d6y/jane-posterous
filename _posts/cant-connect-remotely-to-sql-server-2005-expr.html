I was experiencing an error attempting to connect to a SQL2005 Express database remotely earlier, and couldn't work out why.  I checked the firewall for port 1433 and that was ok.  I checked the "Allow remote connections" box on the properties for the database server, and that was ok.  I then enrolled the help of a colleague and between us we discovered the <a href="http://www.datamasker.com/SSE2005_SAC.htm">Surface Area Configuration Utility</a>.<p />All is now working happily - phew!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-2208272788942031424?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
