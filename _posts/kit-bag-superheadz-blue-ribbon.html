<p>When we were in <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/2010/08/50-hours-in-tokyo/">Tokyo</a> earlier in the year, I found a collection of cameras for sale in <a href="http://www.kiddyland.co.jp/en/">Kiddy Land</a>&nbsp;and couldn't resist coming home with a photographic souvenir. &nbsp;I chose the cheapest of the <a href="http://www.superheadz.com/">Superheadz</a> cameras I could (my <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/kit-bag-blackbird-fly">Blackbird, fl</a>y is by Superheadz so I figured it was a low risk purchase).</p>
<p>It is a very simple camera, but with a lovely wide lens (22mm) and is incredibly light for carrying around. &nbsp;It takes 35mm film and has a slightly rubberised surface. &nbsp;These cameras come in different colours, with different names. &nbsp;Mine is the Blue Ribbon, because it's blue. &nbsp;They are also available in other colours, each with their own names, which makes finding photos taking with them on flickr more of a challenge.</p>
<p>I have now taken 5 films with this camera. &nbsp;4 of them using the delightful Kodak Ektar 100 film. &nbsp;1 of them cross processed using Agfaphoto CT Precisa.</p>
<p>My observations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is incredibly light, and so really very portable and great for taking out with the dog</li>
<li>the lens is so wide, that keeping my fat fingers out of the way can sometimes be challenging</li>
<li>there is quite a lot of vignetting normally, so cross processing a film makes it ultra vignetty</li>
<li>loading and unloading a film is very simple</li>
<li>it loves Kodak Ektar 100 (but then again, so do I!)</li>
</ul>
