<p>Another accidental spot yesterday.  I was heading into London for a <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/blog/2007/05/london-women-in-engineering-tech-talk.html">Google Tech Talk</a> and found myself at the station with time to spare so decided I'd hunt number 10.<p />I'm still hoping to head out at the weekend and hunt down the remaining 9.</p>
