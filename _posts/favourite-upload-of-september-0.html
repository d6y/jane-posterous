    <p>In September I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/archives/date-posted/2010/09/calendar/">uploaded 91 photos to flickr</a>.</p><p>Of these 91, 30 were part of my (relatively) new <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157624913457971/">iPhone 365 project</a>.  This photograph is one of those - day 15 in fact.</p><p>It was taken using hipstamatic (john s lens and blanko film) on my iPhone4.  </p><p>It is of the steps above <a href="http://www.stayinwales.co.uk/wales_picture.cfm?p=3765">Traeth Llyfn beach</a>, possibly the most beautiful beach I've ever had the pleasure to spend time on.  The only way down is via these steps.</p><p>Part of the reason I've chosen this as my photo of the month, is because I know what is just beyond these steps, how beautiful it is, and because I know that I held back from something obviously beautiful to ensure that I got the shot I wanted, with the hand rail just touching the right hand corner, and with the metal grid of the top step level.  I have more photos of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157624812815833/with/4972024174/">our week in Pembrokeshire</a> to process, taken using either the d80 or one of two film cameras I carried around, so don't be surprised to see more of them appearing in my flickr stream.</p></div>
