<p>A few weeks ago <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/JaneFoth/status/107171258151604224">I tweeted</a></p>

<p>You know, no matter how they try, electronic versions of newspapers just aren't as good at being rolled up and stuffed into wet shoes</p>

<p>This got me thinking, again, about the secondary uses of things. So, for example, newspapers, the primary use is getting the news, secondary uses vary from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nigelsecostore.com/acatalog/Paper_Potter.html">paper plantpots</a>&nbsp;to being rolled up and stuffed inside wet shoes, as per my tweet, or in days gone by&nbsp;tomorrow's fish and chips wrapper. We rarely, if ever, have physical newspapers in our house any more. We don't buy them, and our neighbourhood doesn't have a free local paper delivered. So, we've totally reduced our primary need, but our secondary need remains. Is it acceptable to take newspapers out of other people's recycling to meet these secondary needs?</p>
