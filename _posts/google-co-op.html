One of the <a href="http://www.brightonbloggers.com">Brighton Bloggers</a>, <a href="http://www.paulsilver.co.uk/">Paul Silver</a>, did some ground work on <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/">Google Co-op</a> for me.  He created us a Brighton Bloggers search, and added a load of sites to it and added me as a contributor.  Unfortunately as a contributor I could only add sites, I couldn't see what had already been added, neither could I configure the look and feel.  But, Paul assured me it was straightforward so today I gave it a go, and can now unveil the <a href="http://www.brightonbloggers.com/search.php">Brighton Bloggers Search</a> page.  I've added the 248 sites which we currently have registered on the site, and have added it to my list of things to do when adding new blogs to the list.<p />For some reason the markup returned from Google includes a vast amount of white space after the searches, and I haven't yet worked out why, despite rummaging through the <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/docs/cse/">documentation</a>.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-116527054143149272?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
