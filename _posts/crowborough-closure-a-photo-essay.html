</div> When I listened to a <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/2007/04/bobbi-lane.html">Bobbi Lane interview</a> recently about photo essays, and using photography to tell a story, I decided that I should give it a try, and that the closure of our offices in Crowborough was a good place to start.  Not only did I have access to the building, but I have been there most days over the past 3 months when most of the closure activity has been going on.  The <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/galleries/CrowboroughClosure/">resulting photo essay</a> consists of photos taken over the past 3 weeks.  It tells a personal story, taken from my perspective, and I'm sure that others would have chosen different elements to concentrate on.<p />The <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/galleries/CrowboroughClosure/">gallery</a> was produced using <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshoplightroom/">lightroom</a>'s web module and requires <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/about/">flash</a>.<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-8827409479362658657?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
