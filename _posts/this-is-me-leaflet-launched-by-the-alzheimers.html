      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>Alzheimer's Society has launched a leaflet called '<a href="http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/download_info.php?downloadID=399">This is me'</a> for people with dementia who are going into hospital.</p> 
 <p><a href="http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/download_info.php?downloadID=399">'This is me</a>' is a simple and practical tool that someone going into hospital can give to staff to help them understand the condition. It provides a 'snapshot' of the person with dementia, giving information about them as an individual, such as needs, preferences, likes, dislikes and interests. </p> 
 <p>This should enable staff to treat each person as an individual, thereby reducing distress for them and their carers and helping to prevent issues such as malnutrition and dehydration.</p></blockquote><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=1290">alzheimers.org.uk</a></div>
    <p>This is a lovely idea, a couple of pages holding some of the information needed to make a dementia sufferer feel as comfortable as they can in an unfamiliar environment.</p></div>
