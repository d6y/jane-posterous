<p>Today's photographic adventure was much shorter than <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/bpb-a-wednesday-afternoon-adventure">the one a couple of weeks ago</a>. &nbsp;Today, I only visited <a href="http://www.bpb.org.uk/exhibitions/9371/bpb-curated-a-night-in-argentina-alejandro-chaskielberg-and-esteban-pastorino-diaz/">one exhibition, held at the University of Brighton</a>. &nbsp;It is described as:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p><strong>Alejandro Chaskielberg</strong>&nbsp;(ARG) and&nbsp;<strong>Esteban Pastorino Diaz&nbsp;</strong>(ARG) are Argentine photographers whose respective work, in this selection, engages with and further pushes the language of contemporary photography by shooting during darkness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, a disclaimer. &nbsp;I love night and low-light photography. &nbsp;So, any night based work is always going to be of interest to me. &nbsp;And these certainly didn't disappoint. &nbsp;I enjoyed the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.chaskielberg.com/">Alejandro Chaskielberg</a> photographs from the <a href="http://www.chaskielberg.com/#a=0&amp;at=0&amp;mi=2&amp;pt=1&amp;pi=10000&amp;s=2&amp;p=0">High Tide</a> series, but I absolutely loved the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.estebanpastorinodiaz.com/">Esteban Pastorino Diaz</a> work from the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.estebanpastorinodiaz.com/pastorinosalamoneenglish.htm">Salamone</a> series.</p>
<p>His work is beautifully presented in black and white, and yet again, appeals to my sense of the recording of a series of things. &nbsp;The photographs cover examples of the work of the architect <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Salamone">Francisco Salamone</a>, recording Town Halls and Cemetery portals but also slaughterhouses, all photographed at night, on film.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, I did attempt a bit of low light photography, but I really need to read or re-read my two low-light photography books and brush up my theory as they are rather poor attempts when compared against the many great works I've seen during the <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/tag/bpb">BPB/fringe</a> so far this month, reminding me, yet again, how good it is to be inspired by such talented photographers.</p>
