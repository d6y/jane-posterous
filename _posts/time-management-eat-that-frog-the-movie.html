<p><a href="http://remarkablealex.com/">Alex</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/remarkablealex/status/10213087423">tweeted</a> about the <a href="http://www.eatthatfrogmovie.com/">Eat That Frog movie</a> yesterday.  I read <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0340835044?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=janedall-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0340835044">Eat That Frog!: Get More of the Important Things Done, Today!</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=janedall-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=0340835044" border="0" height="1" alt="" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" /> at some point last year, and found this video to be a good reminder of some of the key points.</p>
<p>As a result I also reviewed the notes I made when I was reading the book and picked up a few things that I've let drift over the last few months, namely:</p>
<p><strong>Apply the 80/20 rule to everything</strong> - Resist the temptation to clear up small items first and before starting a task always ask "Is this task in the top 20% of my activities or in the bottom 80%?</p>
<p><strong>Obey the law of forced efficiency</strong> -  <br />Question 1: What are my highest value activities? <br />Question 2: What can I and only I do that, if done well, will make a real difference? <br />Question 3: What is the most valuable use of my time right now?</p>
<p><strong>Put the pressure on yourself</strong> - Imagine every day that you have just received an emergency message and that you will have to leave town tomorrow for a month. What would you absolutely have to get done? Whatever it is, go to work on that task right now.</p>
<p>I have made a note to re-watch this and re-read my notes every 6 months to review how I'm doing.</p>
