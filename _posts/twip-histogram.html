I've been catching up on a few photography podcasts this morning, and came across the excellent <a href="http://twipphoto.com/">TWIP</a> episode about Histograms.  It is a video about 7 minutes long and does a really clear job of explaining what the histogram represents, and how to use it both whilst taking the photos, and afterwards when processing images.<p />The eipsode can be downloaded via <a href="http://www.Pixelcorps.TV/twip017">Pixelcorps.tv</a>.  Great job guys!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-2194281482990540440?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
