<p>An interesting article over at <a href="http://the99percent.com">The 99 Percent</a>&nbsp;about <a href="http://the99percent.com/tips/6956/getting-creative-things-done-ho&amp;aring;w-to-fit-hard-thinking-into-a-busy-schedule#">getting creative things done</a>, rather than just getting things done. &nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As mentioned, the problem faced by to-do list creatives is that we cannot afford to integrate <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html">Graham</a>'s long stretches of uninterrupted work into our schedules. (Though we might want to dedicate a full day to one project, our bosses might disagree.) With this in mind, the GCTD system attempts to replicate the two benefits of uninterrupted work, as described above, in a more realistic, logistics-respecting workday structure.</p>

<p>This is definitely something I've been struggling with lately, and a look at my work calendar quite clearly shows why. &nbsp;Back to back meetings, or meetings with just half an hour or so in between them. &nbsp;I attempted to follow the advice in the article and block out some creative/thinking time, and found 2.5 free hours back to back in 10 days time. &nbsp;I decided this wasn't good enough, so have found 2 hours next Monday morning. &nbsp;The problem is that mornings aren't my best thinking time, so I'm shoe-horning my thinking time into the free slots in my calendar rather than at my peak thinking and creative time. &nbsp;Along with my <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/article-managing-email-overload">email addiction experiment</a>&nbsp;I need to manage my calendar better. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Another commitment: I will own my calendar and rearrange meetings into my least creative/productive times rather than just accepting what other people impose upon me.</p>
