I just realised that I hadn't done an NVQ update for quite some time so thought I'd quickly rectify that. Last time I saw Dawn she took away the evidence and statements for my final module - Unit D3: Recruit, select and keep colleagues. I'm now waiting for the Internal Verifier at City College to provide feedback on what extra bits of evidence I need to provide and then it'll all be sent off to the External Verifier. Hopefully I can get it all finished off before the year is done.
