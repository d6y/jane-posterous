    <p>A beautiful film and a wonderful place. I really like the idea of it being a form of "organ donation". I'd love to be able to wander around there and see what's hiding in amongst all of those bits and pieces, but I can't help but wonder what the future will be for piano tuners/repairers in 8 to 10 years time if shops like this just can't survive? </p><p>Discovered via <a href="http://vimeo.com/saritafrit">Sarita 'Frit' Tam</a></p></div>
