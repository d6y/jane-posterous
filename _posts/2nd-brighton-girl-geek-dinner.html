 <br /> <span style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 0px;">  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/421397945/">Wine!</a>  <br />  Originally uploaded by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/janed/">Jane Dallaway</a>. </span></div>I had another excellent evening last night at the <a href="http://www.brightongirlgeekdinners.co.uk/geekdinners/show/March+2007+Dinner">Brighton Girl Geek Dinner</a>.  This time, <a href="http://www.niquimerret.com/">Niqui Merret</a> spoke about usability and accessibility with Flash.  I know very little about flash, and so found this a really interesting insight into ways that flash can be used for accessibility, a topic Niqui obviously is very knowledgable about.  She had a set of example sites that illustrated various points, and I also had my first ever experience of a screen reader.<p />The food was excellent again, the Eagle certainly know how to put on a buffet.  It is a great venue, and the atmosphere of this geek dinner was relaxed and friendly.  As usual there were lots of interesting people to chat to, from all sorts of backgrounds .<p />The Girl Geek Dinners are excellent, and I hope that Rosie, Devi, Joh and Ribot (in no particular order) managed to enjoy the evening in between their excellent organisation.<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-6410822631405239907?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
