<p>Do you have an object that conjures up thoughts of your family? Does your object bring memories of affection, funny moments or adventures great and small?</p>

<p>I stumbled across the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.barbican.org.uk/objectswithstories/">Objects with stories</a>&nbsp;page at the <a href="http://www.barbican.org.uk">Barbican</a> yesterday and lost quite a few minutes clicking on the pictures, reading the associated memories and relishing the moment.</p>
<p>In both sets of postcards I've had printed for my weekly dispatch to my Mum there have been pictures of objects. In the <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/timeline-and-storyline-postcards">first set of postcards</a>&nbsp;there was an embroidery she had done, in the <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/timeline-and-storyline-postcards-set-2">second set</a> there is a school report, an album and an ornament. All things that had relevance to her and to her life, all things that could be described and shared. I hope that the things I write on them have a similar level of fascination for her and her carers.</p>
