We're planning a trip to Wales for later in the year, and one of the <a href="http://www.caegwynfarm.co.uk/">places we're looking to stay at</a> has the following disclaimer:<p /><i>Please DO NOT use postcode search on Google, Yahoo, etc. as you will be taken to a wrong address. If you are using satellite navigation please ONLY use the coordinates in the format below:<br />Co-ordinates<br />N52.85005<br />W3.91084</i><p />My <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/6110?cp=google6110">new phone</a> has GPS and the Route 66 navigation software.  Great I think.  I'll just pop in the coordinates and away I'll go.  Not so easy as it turns out.  Under the Search options there are the following: <ul><li>Free Text (enter some text and hope for the best)</li><li>Address</li><li>Nearby (i.e. close to where the gps detects I currently am</li><li>History (a list of places I've searched for or been at recently</li><li>Landmarks (places I've entered and saved)</li><li>Contacts (people I have in my address book</li></ul><br />I tried entering N52.85005 into both Free text and address, but to no avail.<br />I did a quick search on the internet, and just found postings from people saying that Route 66 didn't work with longitude and latitude inputs - you can send a longitude and latitude by selecting Send -> Cursor Position or Send -> GPS Position which displays the settings in a text message or other format.<p />After a bit of playing around, I discovered that if you choose to add a Landmark, via the My Landmarks -> New Landmark -> Blank method you can enter the usual information - Name, Street, Zip code, City etc, and at the bottom, tucked out of the way is Latitude and Longitude.  By entering the information in as a landmark, and saving it, I can then show this on the map and use it for navigation purposes. <p />So, not a straightforward method - but it works!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-8138264081044029247?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
