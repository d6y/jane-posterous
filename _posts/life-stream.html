<p>After reading <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/1202/">Jeremy's blog post on life streaming</a> in November I've been thinking of doing a similar thing.  I experimented using <a href="http://janefoth.suprglu.com/">SuprGlu</a> but found the results slow and unreliable - it seems to take quite a while for various posts to get added to the history.  So now, with the help of <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/1265/">Jeremy's more recent post</a>, and <a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com/2007/02/20/aggregating-myself-with-yahoo-pipes/">Grant's post</a> I've managed to <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/6kx8_5XK2xGTBipjJhOy0Q">aggregate</a> my <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/">Jane's technical stuff</a> posts, my <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/tag/photography">Jane's photographic stuff posts</a>, my posts to <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/">Jane and Richard's yak and natter</a>, <a href="http://www.brightonbloggers.com/blog/">Brighton Bloggers posts</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/JaneFoth">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/Ull">del.icio.us</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/">flickr</a>.  Initially I had a few problems with getting the Twitter feed to work, until I remembered that I'd restricted updates.  Once I'd removed that restriction, it all fed together nicely and I have a nice <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/6kx8_5XK2xGTBipjJhOy0Q/run?_render=rss">RSS</a> feed of my posts across the various mediums.</p>
