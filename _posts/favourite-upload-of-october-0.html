<p>In October I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/archives/date-posted/2010/10/calendar/">uploaded 265 photos to flickr</a>.</p>
<p>This photograph was my photo for day 62 of my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157624913457971/">iPhone 365 project</a>.  It also forms part of my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157603406264874/with/5115580734/">Found</a> project and contributes to the sub-project <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157624327841523/with/5115580734/">Found Footwear</a> (if you're interested in why I like the found concept, there is an <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/out-of-place">explanation here</a>)</p>
<p>I like this photograph because I love the colours.  I love the way that the pink looks against the aqua/blue colour. I also love that these shoes are photographed exactly as I found them, when I found them.</p>
