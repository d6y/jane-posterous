This morning I had a problem getting all of my photos off my SD card in a usable format.  I used my usual process: take card out of camera, put into card reader, import into lightroom.  At the end of the import a message appeared telling me that 36 images were in 'unsupported or damaged".  <br /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<br />I can view these images on the camera, but can't view them on my Mac.<br />In the finder window these 36 images are the only ones that don't have a thumbnail image when looking at the contents of the SD card.  I can't view them in Preview, iPhoto or even Nikon Picture Project.<br /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<br />A shell prompt recognises most of my images as "TIFF image data, big-endian" but the "corrupt" ones as "data".<br />This is the 2nd time this has happened, but this time affects 36 photos so I need to:<br /> a) find a way to get these photos off the card and <br />b) make sure this never happens again<p />I decided to head upstairs and grab the direct cable from the box.  My reasons for not using this method most of the time is that I prefer the card reader solution because:<br /> a) it doesn't use up the battery <br />b) the camera isn't lying around on table tops as often and <br />c) I could actually continue shooting whilst the images get transferred onto the computer.<p />I plugged in the cable, looked through finder and the 36 troublesome images had icons.  With fingers crossed I restarted lightroom and let it start an import.  The missing images were all imported.  So, it's a card reader problem.  The card reader I've been using is a Packard-Bell PB-CR300 and at least <a href="http://forum.packardbell.com/en/viewtopic.php?p=102413&amp;sid=748b4892cdb530b9e4ac4bb447d2399b">one other person has had an issue in the past</a>.<p />So today I'll be heading off to find a card reader that will work with high speed, high capacity SD cards.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-63680909069441460?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
