<p>Last night I forwarded an email I'd received to toodledo so that I could action it later. &nbsp;I got a reply, this is most unusual, I don't normally get a reply. On closer investigation it was an error message telling me that my mail couldn't be delivered and giving me just enough of a diagnostic message to be potentially useful.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16px;">I tried to forward my email again, and got the same response. So I raised my first ever&nbsp;<a href="http://www.toodledo.com/info/ticket.php" title="support ticket">support ticket</a> with Toodledo explaining the problem. Within about half an hour I'd got a response, and they'd fixed my problem. &nbsp;What was most rewarding though was the message in the response</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16px;">Thanks for reporting this bug. We were seeing some errors but we hadn't been able to locate the source yet. You helped us find it. It is fixed now.&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16px;">That really made me feel that raising the issue was helpful, and useful, and that I'd contributed to the fix.</span></p>
