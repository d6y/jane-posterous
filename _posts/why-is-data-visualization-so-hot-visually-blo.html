<blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">fundamentally, our visual system is <em>extremely</em> well built for visual analysis. There&rsquo;s a huge amount of data coming into your brain through your eyes; the optic nerve is a very big pipe, and it sends data to your brain very quickly (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982206016393" target="_blank">one study</a> estimates the transmission speed of the optic nerve at around 9Mb/sec). Once that data arrives at the brain, it&rsquo;s rapidly processed by sophisticated software that&rsquo;s extremely good at tasks such as edge detection, shape recognition, and pattern matching.</blockquote>

<p>Really rather taken with measuring the transmission speed of my optic nerve...</p>
