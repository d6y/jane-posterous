<p>I found <a href="http://thechristmascraftcollective.blogspot.com/2010/10/simplest-scarf.html">this pattern</a>&nbsp;a few weeks ago and thought it looked simple and achievable with my limited (4 week old) crochet skills, and what's more I rather liked how it looked. So, I decided to give it a go. I ordered 3 balls of <a href="http://www.sirdar.co.uk/yarns/babyYarns/dkBaby/Snuggly_Baby_Bamboo_DK_F071">Sirdar Snuggly Baby Bamboo Dk</a>&nbsp;and got going.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It really is very simple - it is a well named project - and it's not much more complicated than doing a <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/granny-squares-6-15">granny square</a>. &nbsp;It is just two rows repeated time and time again. It doesn't need a lot of concentration - ideal for keeping restless hands busy whilst listening to podcasts or watching tv. In total it probably took me 8 - 10 hours to do so a pretty quick project, and I would imagine super quick if you're a bit more practiced with a hook.</p>
<p>I used 2 full balls for the length of the scarf, and then used my 3rd ball to make the fringing. I kept measuring the scarf against other scarves in my cupboard to try and work out what was the appropriate length and a full 2 balls seemed to be about right.</p>
<p>Here's me modelling it to give it some form of scale :-</p>

<p>Overall, rather pleased with myself. I made something useful. Hurrah!</p>
