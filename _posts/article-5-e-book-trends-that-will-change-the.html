<p>At McGraw-Hill, we have been an active player in e-book technology dating back to devices like the <a href="http://myrocketbook.com/">RocketBook</a> (one of the first e-book readers) that was launched more than 10 years ago. And today, e-books and e-book distribution is central to our publishing and growth strategy.</p>

<p>(from an article entitled <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/12/27/e-book-publishing-trends/">5 E-Book Trends That Will Change the Future of Publishing</a>&nbsp;written by&nbsp;Philip Ruppel, president of McGraw-Hill Professional)</p>

<div>Interesting insight into how a business, science and technology specialist is viewing the evolution of the e-book. &nbsp;This is quite different to the usual publisher spiel which has mostly focussed on the novel (at least in the articles I have read).  There is also a nice explanation why they need to charge more than $9.99 for a book saying
<blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">
<p>For professional and technical publishers like McGraw-Hill, our e-books cannot stand the low, mass market pricing some consumers think should be applied to every e-book. Our costs are invested in extensive product and editorial development of sophisticated and technical content; the cost of paper, printing, and binding are a fraction of the real expense. And for some very specific and technical subject areas, our markets are much smaller. We simply couldn&rsquo;t afford to publish the work if it must be priced at the everyday low, low price of $9.99.</p>
<p>The real opportunity for publishers will be to develop e-books that offer the kind of interactive features mentioned above. Our customers will demand interactive books that provide a much better, more informed and enriching experience. For them, the experience (not the cost) is often the primary driver.</p>

as well as raising the concept of in-book purchase for extended or more targeted content, such as

They choose the one they need and get a new learning tool, which helps them progress in their class</blockquote>
