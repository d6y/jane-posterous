<p>I've been asked a few times in the last couple of weeks why I've been posting so many <a href="http://janeonthemove.posterous.com/tag/found">photos of found items</a> on my <a href="http://janeonthemove.posterous.com/">janeonthemove</a>&nbsp;photoblog. &nbsp;Most often, these questions have been asked via the medium of twitter, which only allows me 140 characters to reply, so this is my longer version.</p>
<p>Earlier in the year, I decided that I wanted to set myself a couple of <a href="http://janeonthemove.posterous.com/pages/projects-57">photography projects</a> to work on, something I <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/from-the-pocket">alluded to in this post</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I decided to concentrate on a mixed-media project named "<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/tags/outofplace/">Out of Place</a>", documenting items that I found which weren't where they would be expected to be found. &nbsp;As winter turned to spring, and to summer, the items found have changed &nbsp;but the concept being the project hasn't. &nbsp;I'm recording items which are temporary, which may not be photographed again, or have been photographed before. &nbsp;Things which may not be there next time I walk past.</p>
<p>It started with things like this hat:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4337467283/" title="Colourful Lost hat by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4044/4337467283_d453031419.jpg" height="500" alt="Colourful Lost hat" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>and this burnt out car:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4371856431/" title="Abandoned car by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2771/4371856431_d27951358e.jpg" height="333" alt="Abandoned car" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>included a book:</p>

<p>and then as spring and summer arrived, the amount of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157624327841523/with/4774982767/">found footwear</a> started to eclipse most other items featuring trainers:</p>

<p>a lot of single flip flops:</p>

<p>and even including a pair of football boots and socks:</p>

<p>I've no idea where the "Out of Place" project will take me as we leave summer and head towards Autumn and winter, but feel free to keep an eye on my <a href="http://janeonthemove.posterous.com/tag/found">janeonthemove found tag</a> to find out.</p>
