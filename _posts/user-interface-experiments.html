<a href="http://cayne.blogspot.com/">Cayne</a> mentioned <a href="http://www.dontclick.it/">dontclick.it</a> a week or two ago, and I've just had the opportunity to take a look at it, and interact with it.  I quite like it as an alternative interface (maybe it has potential for rsi sufferers) but I'm so used to clicking now that it would take me a while to get used to it in more than a demo.  I find it quite elegant, and some of the site design concepts are lovely - choose Communicate, The Links and use the circular menu navigation.<p />Another interesting interface is <a href="http://liihs.irit.fr/dragice/foldndrop/">Fold n Drop</a> which Richard pointed me at.<p />A couple of interesting interface design concepts.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-112188750387579664?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
