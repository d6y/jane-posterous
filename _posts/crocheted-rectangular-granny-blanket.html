<p><span>At the weekend I did the final round of my rectangular granny blanket. It was based on the pattern found at <a href="http://iamtotallyobsessedwithyarn.blogspot.co.uk/2006/01/granny-square-pattern-with-pictures.html">Granny Square pattern, with pictures</a> as I realised that I didn't actually want a square blanket!</span></p>

<p>It is an easy to follow pattern, and after the first couple of rounds was incredibly easy to do whilst watching the tv or listening to music or whatever. It didn't demand a lot of concentration and I enjoyed watching it grow.</p>
<p>The completed size is 78" x 60", and there are 56 rounds, not counting the middle strip. It is edged simply with a single round of single crochet.</p>
<p>I used a 4mm hook, and 3 different DK yarns:</p>
<ul>
<li>6 balls of Wendy Mode Vapour blue</li>
<li>6 Wendy Mode Whisper white</li>
<li>7 balls of Sirdar Snuggly Baby Bamboo in Tigger</li>
</ul>
<p>It took a couple of months as a "whilst watching tv" kind of projects. The work took place mainly at home in Brighton, but also in Margate whilst visiting my in-laws and in East Yorkshire on a visit to see my Mum.</p>

<p>I have my next crochet project underway, which is a simple filler project to use up some of the <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/granny-squares-6-15">mass of granny squares</a> I made when I was first starting to crochet earlier in the year (as I've mentioned before I don't like wasting things).&nbsp;I am then planning to start on another blanket. This time my plan is to do something stripy so that I can use up some of the yarn mountain I've acquired in the past couple few months. Watch this space!</p>
