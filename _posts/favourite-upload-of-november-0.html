    <p>In November I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/archives/date-posted/2010/11/calendar/">uploaded 170 photographs</a>.</p><p>This photograph was taken as we made our way to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157625080719166/with/5142960695/">Brighton Breeze</a> VW campervan rally on the seafront.  It is under the pier, a place I usually avoid, but the light and water on the path was perfect to get some great reflections going on.  It is the contrast between the white, the red and the black that makes this stand out for me.</p><p>This was taken using my trusty <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/kit-bag-nikon-d80">Nikon d80</a> and my lovely Sigma 30mm 1.4 lens.</p></div>
