<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">It is strange to search for memories of someone who is still alive. To grieve for someone who is not yet gone. But in so many ways you are gone. The mum I knew all my life is not there any more. Your warmth and friendliness; always cheerful, generous, a bit silly, but always my mum. Now you move in a different world, where things don't make sense, where words confuse you. A world that is shrinking each time I see you.</blockquote>

<p>Richard handed me this letter to read at the weekend, whilst we were in Hull primarily to spend time with my Mum who has advanced dementia.</p>
<p>The whole letter is beautiful, especially the paragraph I've quoted above. But, the final paragraph (follow the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/11/letter-to-mother-alzheimers?cat=lifeandstyle&amp;type=article#">link</a> and read it in full) is beautiful, and sad and wonderful and oh, so true.</p>
<p>I wanted to let this letter settle within a bit, and see if it still affected me when I wasn't so (physically) close to Mum, and you know what, it does.</p>
