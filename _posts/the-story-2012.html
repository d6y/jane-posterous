<p>On Friday I had the pleasure of attending a one day conference, <a href="http://thestory.org.uk/">The Story</a>, dedicated to story telling and stories.</p>
<p>This isn't the usual kind of conference that I'd attend, most conferences I've been to are either technical or design related, so this was a new experience for me. The prime reason I wanted to go, is because of the <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/tag/storyline">storyline project</a> I'm undertaking for Mum, both to learn but also to be inspired to continue it and to provide challenges and alternative approaches. It didn't let me down.</p>

<p>I knew a few people who were attending, and planned to look out for them and catch up with them, but in the event, I actually spent most of the day catching up with former Brighton resident, now Sydney dweller, Mary. It was a great way to spend the day. I also managed to catch up with my good friend Neela at lunchtime as she works just over the road from Conway Hall. Double win!</p>
<p>I didn't want to write up my notes/this review immediately afterwards, as I felt I needed to let it "settle" a bit first to see what stuck with me. And I think my key thing is that almost everything discussed, with the noticeable exception of Tom Watson and Emily Bell, was new to me, or had a different perspective on something I thought I knew about. My notes are scribbles of words here and there but aren't full of action points or similar (which is good as I have quite enough stuff on my to do list already!).</p>
<p>Here are some of my highlights:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://bookmaniac.org/">Liz Henry</a>'s talk on "Fake lesbians all the way down" was presented in an engaging, passionate and unfolding way - I was engrossed and hanging on every word. A real storyteller.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://objectiveproductions.com/anthony-owen/">Antony Owen</a> for no other reason than having the job title of "Head of Magic"</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://www.ellieharrison.com/">Ellie Harrison</a> for the sheer obsessiveness of <a href="http://www.ellieharrison.com/index.php?pagecolor=9&amp;pageId=project-confessions">her personal data collection mission</a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://preloaded.com/about/">Phil Stuart</a> and <a href="http://tomchatfield.net/">Tom Chatfield</a> for showing us around <a href="http://playtheend.com/">The End</a>, a game aimed at 13 - 19 year olds which explores thoughts around death and beliefs. This is a subject which I'm keen to see explored more as it is (still) one of life's great inevitablities and yet gets discussed so infrequently, and whilst I can only remark upon my own experiences of dealing with the loss of my Dad last year having some concept of what to expect can only be a good thing.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I think my favourite session was probably <a href="http://scottburnham.com/">Scott Burnham</a> talking about <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/urban-play-by-scott-burnham">Urban Play</a>, lots of beautiful and yet practical designs that graced Amsterdam in 2008. I loved his quote "What we create will always go away, but it's the story of what we do that will always last" (wording taken from <a href="http://thecopyhouse.net/story-2012-conference/">TheCopyHouse's blog post</a> as I only had part of it written down)</p>
<p>I barely tweeted or checked twitter during the day - I was so engrossed with what was happening around me - but looking back at the twitter hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23story2012">#story2012</a>&nbsp;afterwards provided a good overview of what my fellow audience members thought about it.</p>
<p>All in all a great day, and definitely one to look out for again next year.</p>
