Yesterday I bought the North West USA map from Route 66.  It took me a while to play <a href="http://www.mapsofworld.com/usa/usa-maps/maps_of_world_usa_states_city.gif">border identification</a> to determine which states were going to be covered but I was pretty confident that it had what I needed.  For some reason, all you get when you look at a map within Route 66 is a map showing the shape of the areas to be covered, and the longitude and latitude of the top left hand corner and bottom right hand corner.  <p /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<p />So, I went ahead and bought the map, and can confirm that for anyone else trying to find out what states are covered, that these are the ones:<br /><ul><li>Alaska</li><li>California</li><li>Colorado</li><li>Hawaii</li><li>Idaho</li><li>Iowa</li><li>Minnesota</li><li>Montana</li><li>Nebraska</li><li>Nevada</li><li>North Dakota</li><li>Oregon</li><li>South Dakota</li><li>Utah</li><li>Washington</li><li>Wyoming</li></ul><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-2313769289205438341?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
