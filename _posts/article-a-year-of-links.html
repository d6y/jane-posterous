      <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Books also feel apposite for this form of content production. My intent was never to make books, not really to repurpose these links at all. And yet now, at the end of each year, a book can spring into life – built up not through direct intent, but one link at a time over a year. There’s something satisfying about producing an object instantly, even though its existence is dependent on a very gradual process.</blockquote>

    <p>I like this a lot. I've still got an itch to take my momento data from last year and do something physical book based with it. I might have to check out some of the tools mentioned here and see how I get on.</p></div>
