<p>Yesterday I led the the second SQL <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/tag/CodingDojo">coding dojo</a> held as part of the <a href="http://madgex.com/">Madgex</a> <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/tag/ilp">ILP</a> programme.  As with <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/sql-coding-dojo">the first one</a>, I chose a puzzle from my copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Puzzles-Answers-Kaufmann-Management-Systems/dp/1558604537">Joe Celko's SQL Puzzles and Answers</a>.  This time I chose one called One in Ten which I described as follows:<p /></p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">During a data migration exercise a table has been created which takes the outputs of an array and flattens them into a table named Dojo2 which is defined as:<p />Id INTEGER &ndash; Primary Key<br />F1 INTEGER<br />F2 INTEGER<br />...<br />F10 INTEGER<p />Produce a list of rows which have exactly one non zero value in the columns F1 to F10 using any method you like &ndash; select, views, creating new tables etc</blockquote>
<p><br />As with last time, I've put a copy of the SQL file I produced to create the tables and populate the data <a href="http://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B_AkC4ZdTI9tNDMxMjIyNmItYjE3NS00YTkzLWI1OWUtNTJkMDA1NGQxZGY5&amp;hl=en_GB">here</a>, and this time I've also provided two of the solutions from the book <a href="http://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B_AkC4ZdTI9tNDYyOWM2NWEtMDRhMy00MWRlLWFhMjktYzZlZTZlNDkyN2Qy&amp;hl=en_GB">here</a>.<p />Learning from last time's feedback I had a proper keyboard plugged in to my laptop this time.  Other than that I ran it very similarly.  There were only 3 attendees this time, so at each time we had one driver and 2 co-pilots as this seemed more practical.  All of them had keyboard time, and all had co-pilot time.  Again like last time I provided a word document detailing the table layout, the SQL used to create and populate the data, and the expected results - this can be downloaded <a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AfAkC4ZdTI9tZGNwc3d4amNfM2ZyazR0Zmht&amp;hl=en_GB">here</a>. <p />During the practice 2 different approaches were tried, one using string manipulation the other using ABS and max value checking.  The ABS and max value checking method worked for the first 3 columns and so was assumed that it would work across all 10 columns but the participants got a bit fed up of typing as the method chosen - using lots of CASE statements would have been many lines long on completion :-)  <p />The retrospective raised the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generally the session was enjoyed</li>
<li>Each participant learn something and found some areas to follow up on - mainly <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms188420(SQL.90).aspx">SIGN</a>, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189800(SQL.90).aspx">ABS</a> and <a href="http://www.tsqltutorials.com/pivot.php">PIVOT</a></li>
<li>The screen resolution of the laptop when plugged into the big screen was an issue as it was hard to get enough data on the screen at one time - given the number of participants a large standard monitor would have been better</li>
<li>Participants felt that it was good to watch how people tried to solve the problem and learnt from others approaches</li>
</ul>
<p>As with last time, it was enjoyable for me to watch, and I learnt both from setting up the problem in the first place trying out the provided solutions, but also from watching my colleagues try different approaches.</p>
