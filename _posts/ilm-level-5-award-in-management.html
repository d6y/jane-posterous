<p>I completed my <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/tag/nvq">NVQ</a> work towards the end of last year (I'm still waiting for the certificate to arrive - hopefully next week), Madgex have organised for a group of 4 of us to work towards the <a href="http://www.i-l-m.com/learn-with-ilm/1043.aspx">ILM Level 5 Award in Management</a>. &nbsp;This is less evidence based instead being based around workshops, tutorials and work based assessments. &nbsp;The 3 units we're going to cover are:</p>
<ul>
<li>M4.01 Understanding the management role</li>
<li>M5.13 Managing for energy and effectiveness</li>
<li>M5.28 Leading teams</li>
</ul>
<p>I found writing about my progress here helpful last time, helping to keep me motivated, so I plan to do the same again this time. &nbsp;So far we've had our induction, and been handed our handbook - which I've spent the afternoon reading through. &nbsp;The first of the workshops is at the end of the month</p>
