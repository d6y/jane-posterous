<p>When <a href="http://yandleblog.com/">Danny</a> was planning the week of <a href="http://www.skillswap-brighton.org/skillswap/">Skillswap</a>s during the <a href="http://www.brightondigitalfestival.co.uk/">Brighton Digital Festival</a> he asked me if I would be prepared to do a Photography 101 to go along with the other events he had planned.  I decided that I'd give it  go, and so last night saw me presenting on "Digital Photography 101".  I initially wrote this talk for <a href="http://www.barcampbrighton.org/">Barcamp Brighton</a> but didn't have an opportunity to present it. <p />A pdf of my slides can be downloaded <a href="http://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0B_AkC4ZdTI9tYWY1ZTgxOWYtMTUxOS00ODFkLTlhYmYtMTIwNTIyMzdjNzVh&amp;hl=en_GB">here</a> (warning: it's 32MB in size which is the only reason it isn't on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">slideshare</a>) and my accompanying notes can be found <a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AfAkC4ZdTI9tZGNwc3d4amNfN2M2OWptMmY2&amp;hl=en_GB">here</a>.  <p />I felt the presentation went well and I was glad that I'd done a quick around the room to find out experience levels to gauge what level to aim at.  I enjoyed the discussion at the end - some of the topics raised were watermarking, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_watermarking">digital watermarking</a>, multiple exposures/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracketing">exposure bracketing</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging">HDR</a>.<p />We then moved on to considering whether a "Geek Camera Club" or something would be worthwhile, and there certainly seemed to be some people who thought they'd be interested in a monthly meetup.  The preferred format seemed to be based around photographic challenges - things like: taking photos using only a fixed aperture, a fixed focal distance, in black and white, etc.  Certainly I find that having other people issuing me a challenge makes me think more.   If you're interested in a "Geek Camera Club" or similar (based in Brighton probably), then leave me a comment and I'll try and see if I can get something organised.<p />As is typical for a skillswap, we continued the conversation in the Victory.</p>
