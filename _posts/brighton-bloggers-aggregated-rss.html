I've just added a <a href="http://www.brightonbloggers.com/aggregated/">new section</a> to <a href="http://www.brightonbloggers.com/">Brighton Bloggers</a> to take the last 30 or so blogs from the <a href="http://groups.blogdigger.com/rss.jsp?id=3467">aggregated RSS feed</a> and display them on the site.  Hopefully, for those who don't want to read all the posts via RSS they can still get a flavour of what is on offer from <a href="http://www.brightonbloggers.com/blogs/">participants</a>.<p />It is written in PHP and is a customised version of the <a href="http://www.rjk-hosting.co.uk/programs/prog.php?id=7">PHP RSS Reader</a> originally written by <a href="http://www.rjk-hosting.co.uk/">Richard James Kendall</a>.  The script was really easy to customise and I'm really pleased with how it looks.  I could do with a better word than Aggregated though, so if anyone has any suggestions, please let me know.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-5029808853021884059?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
