Initially this looked like it was going to be our best fit tool - it integrated into the IDE really well, it became an option on the tool menu and had a really simple interface for configuring and examing the rules.  <p /><h3>Configuration</h3><br />Configuring rules was simple on a project by project basis - not sure how easy it would be to configure on a wider basis - so that all the rules are shared across many solutions.  It is theoretically possible to add a custom rule making use of an SDK and code editing - there is a <a href="http://community.submain.com/blogs/tutorials/archive/2008/03/16/tutorial-creating-custom-rules.aspx">tutorial</a> on this.<p /><h3>Error detection</h3><br />The errors returned are grouped by project, making filtering really easy.  It even gives an ability to automagically (their word not mine) correct code errors and violations.  When I tried this, my project didn't build any more, although I suspect this may have had something to do with dependency issues - any altered code through this process was commented, such as<br /><span class="code">&nbsp;&nbsp;//ENCAPSULATE FIELD BY CODEIT.RIGHT</span><br />The errors returned for my test project didn't seem to be to as granular a level as I've experienced previously with FxCop - this was a concern.<p /><h3>Automation</h3><br />There is a command line version available which can be incorporated into an automated build process.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-7337041010411620593?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
