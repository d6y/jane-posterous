The <a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit-us/whats-on/temporary-exhibitions/wpy/">Veolia Environment Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2009</a> photography award was announced yesterday, and again its stunning and inspirational, but I feel, at least for me, somewhat unachievable.  The patience that leads to these kind of photos must be incredible.<p /><a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit-us/whats-on/temporary-exhibitions/wpy/photo.do?photo=2554&amp;category=56&amp;group=4">Take a look at the winner</a>.<p />Update: For me, <a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit-us/whats-on/temporary-exhibitions/wpy/photo.do?photo=2518&amp;category=49&amp;group=1">this</a> is an absolutely stunning photo, so beautiful and familiar - here in Brighton the Starlings often swoop around the remnants of the West Pier.  When I get myself a new tripod I may have to try something similar around the West Pier.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-4695317042561651643?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
