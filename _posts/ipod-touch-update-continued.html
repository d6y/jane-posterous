<p>Ok, making progress after my <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/ipod-touch-update">previous post</a>.  I've updated my iPod Touch to be 1.1.3.  I've followed the link for the January Software Upgrade, and attempted to buy it.  Apparently I needed to update my version of iTunes to 7.6, so I've upgraded that.  Now I'm attempting to buy the January Upgrade, but get this error displayed.<p />Sigh.</p>
