    <p>The lovely <a href="http://sebleedelisle.com/">Seb</a> took this photo of me taking photos with my newest acquisition - an Olympus Trip 35 (reconditioned by <a href="http://www.tripman.co.uk/">tripman</a>) - at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/natalie-simon-wedding/">Natalie and Simon's wedding</a> yesterday.  It had a roll of <a href="http://fujifilm.co.uk/film/films/blackwhite_neopan400cn.html">FujiFilm NeoPan</a>  (black and white ISO 400) in it, but was only my 2nd film with this camera so my fingers are firmly crossed for good results.</p></div>
