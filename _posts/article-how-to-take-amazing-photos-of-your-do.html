<p>As a fervent photographer of my dog, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/tags/skitters/" title="Photos of Skitters">Skitters</a>, I was interested to stumble across the article <a href="How to take amazing photos of your dog">How to take amazing photos of your dog</a> the other day. &nbsp;It covers both recommended equipment, and a selection of shots to try. &nbsp;Some of these I've got examples of amongst my 305 Skitters photos. &nbsp;Others I have yet to try. &nbsp;For my own reference I thought I'd list the recommended positions, and post example Skitters photos where I have them. &nbsp;All of them are useful and good techniques for getting a more unusual shot of your 4 legged friend.</p>
<p><strong>Position yourself low</strong></p>
