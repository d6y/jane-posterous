<p>With Timeline, you can even add points in time when loved ones have died, and accompany those dates with pictures, text and video. To me, that further demonstrated how Timeline really is capable of profound emotional impact. I&rsquo;m going to go back and add pics of my late mother and father, along with writings of my own personal remembrances. I&rsquo;ll scan lots of pictures &mdash; finally Dad&rsquo;s old shoeboxes full of photos will become useful &mdash; and show what life was like back then. I&rsquo;ll make it private, just for me. And it&rsquo;ll add something to my life that was missing before.</p>

<p>The more I think about this, the more I think the perspective of someone who has lost a loved one changes how much value these reminiscences have. It's probably a yearning to feel connected in some way. But I don't want my curation of my family photos to be locked into a platform, especially not one as restrictive, and hard to get your data out of as facebook. I've spent a bit of time today looking at <a href="http://&quot;forgetmenotbook.com">Forget Me Not Book</a> as a story storing/sharing/telling mechanism - I want to love it, but there are few bits that are just too clunky, and again, I'm trusting them to store my stories in a format I can reclaim at a later stage. This feels like its going to end up being a roll-my-own solution which I really didn't want to do.</p>
