I'm not sure we got an answer to the question but we went on some interesting journeys touching on whether we even like the phrase "girl geek", what is a geek (<a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=geek">someone who bites the head of chickens</a>), why more women aren't going into IT, what stops women going to conferences etc<p />I also won a prize, a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Web-Standards-Creativity-Innovations-Scripting/dp/1590598032/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/026-5323665-9026809?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1180558225&amp;sr=8-1">Web Standards Creativity: Innovations in Web Design with XHTML, CSS, and DOM Scripting</a> with an introduction by Brighton's own <a href="http://www.andybudd.com/">Andy Budd</a>.  It looks like a good collection of topics by some knowledgable people.<p />All in all another great Girl Geek Dinner.<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-6523840067205620209?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
