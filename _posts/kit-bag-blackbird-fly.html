<p />When Richard returned from his trip to the US for Java One, he brought me a <a href="http://www.superheadz.com/bbf/">Superheadz Blackbird, Fly</a> back.  I'd seen these, and photos from them on flickr over the past few months and thought they looked fun.<p />It has 9 focussing zones - 0.8m, 1.5m, 2m, 2.5m, 3m, 4m, 5m, 10m and &infin;<br />It has 2 shutter speeds 1/125th of a second, and bulb<br />It has 2 apertures f7 and f11<br />It has a flash hot shoe (which I haven't tried yet)<br />It has a fixed 33mm lens<br />It has 3 formats - standard 35x24mm, square 24x24mm, full (over the sprocket holes)<p /><br />It is a very light, fairly simple camera available in a multitude of bright colours.  Mine is the lovely bright orange colour.<br />I've now taken 4 films with it, all with Kodak Portra film stock, 3 VC400 and one VC160.  <p />After a couple of months of use, my observations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>looking down into the viewing area shows the scene in reverse due to the mirror.  This makes getting horizons straight pretty tricky (as evidenced by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/3778678658/">this</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/3705120562/">this</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/3778715362/">this</a>)</li>
<li>it's incredibly light and really easy to transport making it an ideal companion for dog-walking</li>
<li>the ability to change the format on a film by film basis (square, standard, full) makes it pretty adaptable and good to experiment with and play</li>
<li><a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/loading-film-into-the-blackbird-fly">loading a film can be a bit complex</a></li>
<li>I'm getting better at remember to check the zone before I take a photo although I still have my moments...</li>
<li>I need to get better at estimating distances to get the right zone at the right time :-)</li>
<li>overall, it's good fun</li>
</ul>
