<br />Photo &copy; and reproduced with kind permission from <a href="http://www.waynelevinimages.com/">Wayne Levin</a><p />One of the photographers mentioned during one of the <a href="http://photohistory.jeffcurto.com/archives/82">Summer School</a> <a href="http://photohistory.jeffcurto.com/">History of Photography podcast</a>s was <a href="http://www.waynelevinimages.com/">Wayne Levin</a>.  The podcast featured underwater photography as its theme as it was 82 years since <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/">National Geographic Magazine</a> published color underwater photographs.  <p />Wayne Levin produces black and white underwater photographs, and they're stunning.  I think part of why I like his photos is that they're not usual - I'm so used to seeing blue coloured underwater photos, with vibrant colours of fish so the starkness of the black and white makes me look at them in a different way.  I think my favourites are some of the <a href="http://www.waynelevinimages.com/images/FISH+SCHOOLS/">fish schools</a> photographs, with my (current) absolute favourite being <a href="http://www.waynelevinimages.com/images/index.php?album=FISH+SCHOOLS&amp;image=Column+of+Akule+%28SC-215%29.jpg">Column of Akule</a> (shown above).</p>
