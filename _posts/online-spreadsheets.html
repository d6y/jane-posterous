Via <a href="http://www.larkware.com/dg6/TheDailyGrind953.aspx">larkware</a>, a good <a href="http://sudarmuthu.com/blog/2006/06/13/online-spreadsheets-comparison.html">comparison article on 5 of the online spreadsheet offerings</a> (warning: this article doesn't seem to work in <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/">Safari</a>).  Of the 5, I have to confess that I've only had chance to play with <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com">Google spreadsheets</a> so far, but as a consequence of the article I've just signed up to <a href="http://irows.com/">iRows</a> as well.  I'll have to take a look and see which works best on Safari or <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a>.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-115627943296953577?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
