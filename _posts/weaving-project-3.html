<p>Weaving project #3 was an evolution of <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/weaving-attempt-2">project #2</a>&nbsp;featuring the picture frame loom, and a similar set up. The aim this time was to make a bookmark, and for it to be ready before Christmas as a gift. This meant I had to get my edges as straight as I could and that the pressure was on.</p>
<p>For this project I used embroidery silks as my warp, and another fluffy yarn for the weft (again taken from my <a href="http://janeonthemove.posterous.com/yarn-delivery-or-how-to-ensure-that-your-next">selection of undyed yarns</a>). The embroidery silks worked ok, but did have a tendency to split meaning it was all too easy to thread the weft through the warp rather than over/under it. They did provide good colour options for the two tassled ends though.</p>
<p>As with my other projects, the weft was very tight, meaning that none of the warp thread is visible (probably due to me being a bit too heavy handed with my kitchen fork (being used as a beater)). This is something I'm going to work on remedying in project #4 but that actually worked as I wanted for this project. I did have a major unweaving at one point as I changed how was I beating the weft at one point, trying my fingers instead of a fork, but this ended up flattening the lovely fluffy bits of the yarn, so I removed that thread and threw it away and replaced it using my usual fork technique. Another issue I faced was trying to work out what the optimum size for a bookmark was. I gathered up all of the different bookmarks I had and none of them were consistent in height or width. I picked one that seemed to be a good size for most books, and based the sizing on that. The other thing I worked out doing this project, was that I could use a chain stitch line at the top and bottom of my loom to space out the weft threads - this worked really well and created a bit more of an even distribution.</p>
<p>I finished this project using the hemming technique as described/shown in this video which worked pretty well and seems to be pretty robust. I still haven't found a hemming technique that would work when tassles aren't required though.</p>

<p>So, here it is on the loom with weaving completed, ready to be removed and finished.</p>

<p>And here it is off the loom and finished. I had quite a job trying to get the tassle bits to be consistent in length and I don't think I ever did manage it properly as they had a tendency to spring off in all directions and not lie straight. I find the finishing process the most difficult still.</p>

<p>Overall, I'm pretty happy with it, the edges are pretty straight, it looks pretty good and I think it should function as a bookmark without too many problems.&nbsp;</p>
