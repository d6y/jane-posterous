There is an excellent article over at <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Creating Passionate Users</a>, <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2007/02/dont_ask_employ.html">Don't ask employees to be passionate about the company!</a> which examines the differences between people who have a passion for their employee and a passion for their work.  I think I might involve the simple 4-question test into any interviews I do in the future as it is a good match to some of the questions I already ask ("Have you contributed any code or writings to the wider community").<br /><ul><li>When was the last time you read a trade/professional journal or book related to your work? (can substitute "attended an industry conference or took a course")</li><br /><li>Name at least two of the key people in your field</li><br /><li>If you had to, would you spend your own money to buy tools or other materials that would improve the quality of your work?</li><br /><li>If you did not do this for work, would you still do it (or something related to it) as a hobby?</li></ul><p />I've always been interested in recruiting team members with a passion for their trade, who are keen to learn and show their ability.  Hopefully these questions will help me to achieve this in the future.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-4648972984362033467?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
