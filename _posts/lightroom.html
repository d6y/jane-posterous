I've done it, I've just ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Adobe-Photoshop-Lightroom-PC-Mac/dp/B000MQCFJQ/richarddallaway">Lightroom</a>.  It should dispatch next Friday.  I have no idea why it isn't available already as my beta has now expired and I'm without Lightroom for 10 days.   Aagghh!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-6642506478122372558?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
