<p>The more I read about <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/tag/timemanagement">time management</a>, the more I feel that I need to understand where my time goes. &nbsp;I have systems in place for tracking the things I need to get done, but I don't really track my time, or my distraction quota at any given time, so I feel it is time to start. &nbsp;So, I'm looking for an iPhone app to help. Here's what I want it to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>allow me to record time as it happens, or retrospectively, against a task</li>
<li>allow me to have a hierarchy of tasks</li>
<li>allow me to record how distracted I am during a time period (I know that my best concentration time is around 3pm - 5.30pm but currently aren't sure what my other peaks and troughs are)</li>
<li>allow me to record notes against a task</li>
<li>allow me to export my data in some format so that I can analyse it and work out where my time drains are</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't bill clients or anything, so I'm not bothered whether it allows me to have different rates per project etc</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
