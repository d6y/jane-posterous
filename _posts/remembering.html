<p>I've had 2 pieces of work to blog about in my list for a while, and it was only when I revisited them today that I thought about combining them in one post.</p>
<p>First, the background, my Mum has dementia. She was diagnosed almost 10 years ago, and I've watched her change from an independent, laughing, funny, lively person, to a shell of a lady who can no longer communicate with us, nor recognise us. The 2 artists below have focussed on photographing people with dementia or Alzheimer's and both of them resonate with me.</p>
<p>Firstly, <a href="http://www.alextennapel.nl/">Alex Ten Napel</a>, who has a <a href="http://www.alextennapel.nl/portraits-pages/alzheimer.html">set of portraits</a> of Alzheimer's sufferers. The <a href="http://vervephoto.wordpress.com/2010/10/06/alex-ten-napel/">original article I saw</a>, showed the following 2 photographs, side by side</p>

<p>When I first saw these photographs I cried. I cried because the face on the right has the same look in the eyes that I see when I look at my Mum. A look of confusion, of fear, of bewilderment.</p>
<p>The second photographer, this time covered by <a href="http://lenscratch.blogspot.com">lenscratch</a>, is <a href="http://www.greggsegal.com/">Gregg Segal</a>. His <a href="http://lenscratch.blogspot.com/2010/11/gregg-segal.html">project is called&nbsp;Remembered: The Alzheimer's Project</a>&nbsp;and focuses more on the displacement of time and memories. He says of his project</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>For people with Alzheimer's, the past becomes the present. Distant memories shift from background to foreground. To illustrate the past's prominence, I've included it in each picture--in the form of a projected slide image</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>The most wrenching part of witnessing the dissolution of a loved one is that you have them whole in the same moment that they're gone. That simultaneity of have and losing, that nostalgia, is at the heart of Remembered.</p>

<p>For a year or so I didn't really take any photos of my Mum because I didn't want to record her decline, and remember these parts of her life. But 18 months or so ago I started again, and I've now got a few photos of her taken in her residential home. &nbsp;This one was taken last November on one of her better days.&nbsp;</p>
