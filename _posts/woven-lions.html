<p>I stumbled across <a href="http://weave-away.blogspot.com/">Amanda's Weaving blog</a>&nbsp;fairly recently, and have been fascinated watching her latest project come together.</p>
<p>It started <a href="http://weave-away.blogspot.com/2012/03/roar.html">here</a>, where she outlines what she wants to do, progresses <a href="http://weave-away.blogspot.com/2012/03/1-7-3-8-5-1.html">here</a>, where she threads, then moves on to <a href="http://weave-away.blogspot.com/2012/03/duped-almost.html">here</a>, where she starts the weaving, to <a href="http://weave-away.blogspot.com/2012/03/room-with-view.html">here</a>, which features some beautiful progress photographs, to <a href="http://weave-away.blogspot.com/2012/03/3604-square-inches.html">here</a>, where it has come off the loom, and on to <a href="http://weave-away.blogspot.com/2012/03/heart-of-lion.html">here</a>, where it has started to be assembled in to the finished articles, and then <a href="http://weave-away.blogspot.com/2012/03/cornucopia-clown-hair-mane.html">here</a>, where the first one is assembled with a cute little mane, to <a href="http://weave-away.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/lion-king.html">here</a>, where there are three of the little fellas.</p>
<p>So, from</p>

<p>Truly a weaving inspiration. I love that these cute little fellas are made from fabric which Amanda has made herself, to her own specification. Too much sewing involved to make it on to my to make list, but delightful none the less.</p>
