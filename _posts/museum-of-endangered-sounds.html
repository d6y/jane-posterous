<p>Imagine a world where we never again hear the symphonic startup of a Windows 95 machine. Imagine generations of children unacquainted with the chattering of angels lodged deep within the recesses of an old&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube" style="color: #6699cc;">cathode ray tube TV</a>. And when the entire world has adopted devices with sleek, silent touch interfaces, where will we turn for the sound of fingers striking QWERTY keypads? Tell me that. And tell me: Who will play my GameBoy when I'm gone?</p>
<p>These questions and more led me to the undertaking that is The Museum Of Endangered Sounds.</p>

<p>As I alluded to in <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/the-listening-project">this post</a>, we have so many images of our shared past, but so few sounds, so this project really appeals.</p>
