<p>I've read a couple of articles that have mentioned perfection with regards to hand made items over the last few days. And then I popped into the <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/">British Museum</a> before meeting a friend for lunch and spotted this sign on a scarf and I couldn't resist taking a photo of it. In case you can't read it, it says &ldquo;slight irregularities in weave and dyeing are an inherent part of a handmade product.&rdquo; (The scarf is by <a href="http://www.tarantaaran.net/story.htm">taran taraan</a>)</p>

<p>The first article I spotted that made me think of this was <a href="http://www.etsy.com/blog/en/2012/denyse-schmidt-modern-quilts-traditional-inspiration/">Denyse Schmidt: Modern Quilts, Traditional Inspiration</a> which has the following paragraph in it:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Along the way, Schmidt found herself attracted to old quilts. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re so full of stories and you wonder about the person who made them,&rdquo; she says. She was especially drawn to those stitched with random fabrics, whose seam lines don&rsquo;t meet exactly. &ldquo;There is so much beauty and personality in the wonkiness&mdash; there&rsquo;s a kind of looseness in them, like a hand-drawn line,&rdquo; she says.</blockquote>
<p>And then I read <a href="http://laurasloom.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/on-not-being-perfectionist-or-perfect.html">On Not Being a Perfectionist (or Perfect!)</a> in which Laura says</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">I have a confession to make.  I am not a perfectionist.  I am all too aware that I am not perfect and that - mostly - I do not create perfect work.</blockquote>
<p>Perfect is not a word I can use for any of my craft projects at the moment. They are definitely at the "wonky and personality-filled" end of the scale, with plenty of irregularities. And you know, I think I'm alright with that, I haven't been doing any of these things very long, and I'm very definitely still learning. As long as each thing can be classed as progress, I thnk that's fine.</p>
