      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">The insatiable desire for ever more and ever newer forms of convenience that drives our global economy and our technological culture leaves a scattered trail of obsolescence in its wake. As much as I don’t want my bookshelves to become part of this trail of obsolescence, I can already see early warning signs of my own desire for convenience — for instantly getting what I want, for not having to deal with mere objects in all their cumbersome actuality — beginning to outrank my love of the book as a physical thing. I don’t want my identity as a consumer, as a ruthless pursuer of the most user-friendly and cost-effective option, to supersede my identity as a booklover. I don’t look forward to a future in which my Kindle (or whatever device inevitably succeeds it) is the only book on the shelf. But it’s a future I’m fairly convinced is awaiting us, and it’s one that I, as a consumer, am playing my part in advancing us toward.</blockquote>

    <p>Interesting essay about ebooks and the conflict (often only manifested internally) of loving books and loving reading.</p><p>I still love my kindle. I'm extremely attached to it and it travels to work with me most days, in case I get some time during my lunch break to read a bit. But I also still love physical books, its just that I'm more choosy about the books that I buy in a physical format - photography books, illustrated books etc - books where the physicality is part of the experience</p></div>
