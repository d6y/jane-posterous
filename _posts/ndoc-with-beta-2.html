I've been struggling to get <a href="http://ndoc.sourceforge.net/">NDoc</a> to work properly with Beta 2 code this afternoon.  I followed the instructions on the <a href="http://ndoc.sourceforge.net/wiki/dotNet_2.0_Support">NDoc wiki</a> to get it to be able to open the .exe, but then couldn't seem to get much further for a while.  After a few failed attempts I've set my Beta 2 project to publish XML documentation, rebuilt my solution and configured NDoc to look at that XML file through the <a href="http://ndoc.sourceforge.net/reference/NDoc.Core.AssemblySlashDoc.SlashDoc.html">SlashDoc</a> setting.  All is now working happily, and the output produced is very smart indeed.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-112186987360766699?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
