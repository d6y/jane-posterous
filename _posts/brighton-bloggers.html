I've just posted a <a href="http://www.brightonbloggers.com/blog/archives/2007_03_01_index.php#5998287008829769766">request for comments</a> over at <a href="http://www.brightonbloggers.com/">Brighton Bloggers</a> - a site I've been looking after for the past 4 or so years, and which is mainly hand coded HTML without an admin site (which when there are now 268 blogs makes it pretty time intensive).  Feel free to add your <a href="http://www.brightonbloggers.com/blog/archives/2007_03_01_index.php#5998287008829769766">feedback and comments</a> on how I should improve the site - especially with regards to categorisation etc when I embark on writing an admin site.<p />Thanks!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-8825642140039374162?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
