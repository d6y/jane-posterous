<p>to which I <a href="http://twitter.com/JaneFoth/status/25400131396">responded with</a></p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">
<p>@jamesbradshaw&nbsp;your name is even mentioned in the version history "suggestion by James Bradshaw"</p>

<p>and to which he responded with</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">
<p>@JaneFoth&nbsp;I have have just had the pointed out in the office. I have just to mod it to cope with schema names do you want my editions?</p>

<p>To which I of course said yes. &nbsp;James sent the updated procedure through, and spurred on by his activity, I also added a fix I'd been considering for a while - to allow the procedure to deal with tablenames which have a . in them, after having recently discovered that this was valid (basically by wrapping the table name in [ and ]).</p>
<p>So, no updates in over a year, and then 2 in one day. &nbsp;Must be the same as how it is with buses... &nbsp;Anyway, as usual the updated procedure can be found <a href="https://github.com/janedallaway/SQL-Server-Helper-Scripts/blob/master/spu_generateInsert.sql">here</a>&nbsp;and is listed on my <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/pages/downloads-12">downloads page</a>.</p>
