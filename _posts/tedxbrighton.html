<p>Yesterday I had the fortune and great pleasure to attend the first <a href="http://tedxbrighton.co.uk/">TEDxBrighton</a>. &nbsp;I started the day playing down my expectations, trying not to expect too much from the event to avoid any element of disappointment. &nbsp;I ended the day delighted that the day had delivered to those original high expectations and realising that I needn't have worried. &nbsp;What follows are my mind-map style notes of the talks, complete with mis-spellings, smudges and sometimes barely legible scrawl. &nbsp;More detailed notes from the day from another attendee can be found <a href="http://gregdreyfus.wordpress.com/2011/01/21/half-way-through-tedxbrighton/">here</a> and <a href="http://gregdreyfus.wordpress.com/2011/01/21/tedxbrighton-part-deux/">here</a>, and I'm sure there are more yet to be written, published and distributed by others.</p>

<p>TEDxBrighton was a well run event, with a high calibre of, mainly local, speakers. It was also one of the first conferences I've been to where the queue for the ladies was as long as for the gents. I appreciate it wasn't as much of a tech conference as those I'm more used to but none the less, it was good to see so many women attendees, and speakers for that matter.</p>
<p>Given the opportunity to attend another one, I'd leap at it.</p>
