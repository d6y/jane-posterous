<p>As part of <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/timelines-and-storylines">my storyline project</a>, I want to be able to gather notes, images, PDFs etc and categorise them so I can then get at them in related "stories". &nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's an example of some user stories:</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I find a copy of a school report. I scan it to PDF. I then want to categorise it against</p>
<ul>
<li>date (in this case, either a year or a decade)</li>
<li>name (of student)</li>
<li>location (of school)</li>
<li>chapter (school)</li>
</ul>
<p>&gt;&gt; I receive a letter from a family friend who reminds me about a family holiday which I may later be able to track down some photos of. &nbsp;I want to categorise it as</p>
<ul>
<li>date (probably a year, at least a decade)</li>
<li>name (of people who were there - my family, the family friend, their family)</li>
<li>location (of where we took the holiday)</li>
<li>chapter (holiday)</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As an aside, I can't think of a good word for the areas/categories/chapters/whatever which cover things like school, work, holiday, music, netball, church etc - these are the things that will probably become the central points of the stories I will write, and I already have items on my to write about list such as "Write about Mum and netball". &nbsp;Any suggestions welcomed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I know that I want to write about Mum and netball, so I look through my collected information based on chapter (netball) and then order by date to get the information in one place. I then use it to write my story - which may include some of the photos, like the photo of her and her team, or a photo of the (tarnished) silver trophy I have sitting upstairs in our spare room.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I know that I want to use what I've gathered to put together a timeline of her life - where she was (roughly) and what she was doing when, so I want to get at all the data, ordered by date.</p>
<p>I'd wondered about using <a href="http://www.evernote.com/">evernote</a>, but it doesn't seem to give me an easy way to get my data back out of it in a very usable/transferrable method (happy to be proved wrong). I've experimented with <a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php">Scrivener</a>, but I couldn't work out a way of tagging chunks of information in different ways. So, what other tools are there? What would be worth me spending an hour or so playing with to see if I can coerce it into doing what I need?</p>
