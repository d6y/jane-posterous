<a href="http://www.gerdludwig.com/">Gerd Ludwig</a> is the subject of the <a href="http://www.mulita.com/blog/?p=46">most recent videocast</a> from <a href="http://www.mulita.com/blog/">George Jardine on Adobe Lightroom</a>.  It is presented in a really interesting format, with the audio track being an interview between George and Gerd, and the visuals being a photo slideshow of photographs that relate to the conversation.  The tie up between audio and choice of photograph is really well done, and whilst originally I thought that this format might be distracting, by a few minutes in (it has a 45 minute duration) I was really appreciating it and enjoying the conversation and imagery.<p />If you have a spare 45 minutes, and a spare 105MB then its worth downloading and watching (the podcast can be downloaded from <a href="http://idisk.mac.com/george_jardine-Public?view=web">George's iDisk</a> - it is labeled "20071120 Podcast - Gerd Ludwig").<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-6223168455718028294?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
