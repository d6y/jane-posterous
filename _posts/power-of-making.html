<p>Last weekend I had a thoroughly enjoyable slow wander around the <a href="http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/exhibitions/power-of-making/">Power of Making</a> exhibition at the wonderful <a href="http://www.vam.ac.uk/">V&amp;A</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.daltonmghetti.com/artistimages/gallery/full/Ghetti-Alphabet.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Amongst the exhibits were the <a href="http://www.daltonmghetti.com/">Dalton Ghetti</a> Alphabet - an incredibly detailed collection of (normal) pencils carved with letters of the alphabet. The photograph of this doesn't do it justice. The sheer smoothness, and straightness of the carvings were amazing and we returned for a second admiring glance before leaving the exhibition.</p>
<p>If you can get yourself to London, and to the V&amp;A before the 2nd January, it is well worth a look</p>
