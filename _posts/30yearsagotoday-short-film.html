<p>A month or so ago I met with <a href="http://vimeo.com/saritafrit">Frit</a> to talk about my <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/tag/storyline">storyline project</a>, and she was rather taken with the <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/introducing-30yearsagotoday">30YearsAgoToday</a> aspect of it. As a film-maker, her filmy brain started ticking over, and she came up with an idea. She'd like to do a short film for a follow friday - something she'd never seen anyone else do before.</p>
<p>We did some planning, and worked out what I needed to prepare (mainly the wording for my audio), and on Wednesday evening Frit and Natalie came over and filmed it.</p>

<p>Until we laid out all of the diaries and notebooks (which Mum used to draft entries in her later years when her memory had started to fail her) I don't think even I had appreciated the sheer amount of words that she'd committed to paper. Something about having them laid out makes it seem much more overwhelming, than them just sitting on a shelf.</p>

<p>Frit <a href="https://twitter.com/saritafrit/status/216105885192298496">promoted the film yesterday as her follow Friday</a>, funnily enough whilst I was on a train heading to spend some time with my Mum, and after a bit of a problem getting enough mobile internet coverage to watch it, I watched it two or three times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the finished video is beautiful, and I'm delighted with it. It's been wonderful to watch something go from an idea discussed over a cup of tea a few weeks ago, to a finished film.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, here is the finished film, complete with my audio explanation:</p>
