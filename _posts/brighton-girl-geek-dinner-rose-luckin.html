<p />Last night was the <a href="http://www.brightongirlgeekdinners.co.uk/geekdinners/show/January+2007+Dinner">first</a> <a href="http://www.brightongirlgeekdinners.co.uk/geekdinners/">Brighton Girl Geek Dinner</a> and most enjoyable it was as well.  Great turnout, excellent organisation (name stickers, information sheet, guest book) and an interesting talk by <a href="http://www.lkl.ac.uk/cms/index.php?option=com_comprofiler&amp;task=userProfile&amp;user=128">Rose Luckin</a> on Learner Centred Design, covering completed projects on <a href="http://www.lkl.ac.uk/graphics/projectsheets/homework.pdf">homework</a> and <a href="http://www.lkl.ac.uk/graphics/projectsheets/ar.pdf">augmented reality</a>, and touching on a new project <a href="http://www.lkl.ac.uk/graphics/projectsheets/vesel.pdf">vesel</a>.<p /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<p />I had some interesting conversations ranging from <a href="http://www.mariaphotographer.com/">photography</a>, through process management, training needs, print versus web and the benefits of both and finally what kind of <a href="http://wellieswithwings.blogspot.com/">wings would be on Sophie's wellies</a>.  <p /><a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/fp/">Future Platforms</a> hosted a text voting mechanism to vote for subjects we'd like to hear talked about at future events - everything got at least one vote, and the winners seemed to be in the game and social area as well as the future of technology. <p /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
