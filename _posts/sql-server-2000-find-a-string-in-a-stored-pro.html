I've been debugging and <a href="http://tsqlunit.sourceforge.net/">unit testing</a> some involved stored procedures, and I've left a trail of PRINT statements all over the place.  I was having real difficulties tracking the last 2 down, so I wrote the following SQL to help me track them down. <br /><span class="code"><br /> SELECT o.name <br /> FROM syscomments c<br /> INNER JOIN sysobjects o<br /> ON c.id = o.id<br /> WHERE o.xtype = 'P'<br /> AND text LIKE 'PRINT @'<br /></span><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-115338798770560898?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
