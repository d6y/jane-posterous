<p>For my birthday this year, one of Mum&rsquo;s work friends (who I didn't really know at all, but who was kind enough to respond to my request for stories from earlier times to help fill out Mum&rsquo;s <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/tag/storyline">storyline</a>) kindly sent me a birthday card.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>When I opened the card I was confused that it was addressed to me as my full name, and inside the card was a small envelope. Inside that was&nbsp;</span>the announcement of my birth card that Mum and Dad had sent her all those years ago<span>. What an amazing thing to have.</span></p>

<p>This wouldn&rsquo;t have happened without my storyline project, and even if nothing more ever comes of it than this, it's been worth it.</p>
