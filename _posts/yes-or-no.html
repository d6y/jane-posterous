This is the dialog box that greeted me when I started up my work laptop this morning.  <p /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<p />So, is it a question which is missing a bit of punctuation? i.e. "Error in configuration?"  In that case, the answer is no, I don't want an error but thank you for asking.<p />Or is it a statement - there has been an error - in which case why the Yes and No buttons? And what is the appropriate response?<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-8785258132060115044?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
