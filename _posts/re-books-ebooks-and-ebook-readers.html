<p>In amongst the post I wrote the other day about <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/books-ebooks-and-ebook-readers">Books, eBooks and eBook readers</a> I said</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p>Another item that concerns me is the cost of eBooks.  I often buy novels from bookshops as part of a 3 for 2 offer or similar.  Looking at the iBooks store I was amazed to discover that for one book I was considering, it actually cost more than it would to walk into a bookstore and buy it at full RRP.  This doesn't seem right to me somehow.  And it doesn't mean that I value the author's work any less, just that there is a lot less delivery costs involved with getting the content to me, and I expect to see the benefit of some of that.</p>

<p>What I hadn't appreciated until <a href="http://twitter.com/jonnynexus">jonnynexus</a> retweeted <a href="http://twitter.com/pressfuturist">Press Futuist</a>'s <a href="http://twitter.com/pressfuturist/status/613041741758464">tweet</a></p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Why UK ebooks aren't much cheaper than print in &lt;140 characters. VAT @17.5% on ebooks (not print) outweighs manufacturing savings of c. 12%.</blockquote>
<p>was the VAT aspect. &nbsp;The <a href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/">HMRC</a> has a lovely page about <a href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageVAT_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000102&amp;propertyType=document">Zero-rating of books etc</a> which has some rather delightful and comical definitions of what constitutes a zero rated book, for example</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><a href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageVAT_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000102&amp;propertyType=document#P59_5413">These normally consist of text or illustrations, bound in a cover stiffer than their pages. They may be printed in any language or characters (including Braille or shorthand), photocopied, typed or hand-written, so long as they are found in book or booklet form.</a></blockquote>
<p>but it would appear to be the following paragraph which differentiates the supply of an eBook rather than the book itself</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageVAT_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000102&amp;propertyType=document#P53_4056">The supply of text by electronic transmission, via the internet, or similar means is also standard-rated. Such supplies are of services, not of goods, and different VAT rules will apply to them (such as those on the place of supply of services &ndash; see Notice 741 Place of supply of services.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, you pay VAT for the service of being able to download the book, rather than the book itself. &nbsp;The content is still zero-rated (I think!).</p>
<p>Interesting stuff!<span style=""> </span></p>
