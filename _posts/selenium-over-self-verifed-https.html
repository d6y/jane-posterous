I wrote some <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a> tests a while ago for one of our web based applications, and these tests were working fine until I applied a self-verified SSL certificate to the site (the final version will have a proper certificate, but I just wanted to test it locally). This caused me a little bit of head scratching and googling until I found out about <a href="http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Profiles">firefox profiles</a> and <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_Manager#Creating_a_new_profile">how to create a new profile</a> just for my selenium scripts to consume (cutting the profile down to the 2 files as recommended in <a href="http://townx.org/blog/elliot/dealing-self-signed-ssl-certificates-when-running-selenium-server-firefox">this article</a>)<p />My selenium scripts had been working on the theory that I'd already started the selenium server, i.e. relying on me running a .bat file containing <br /><span class="code">java -jar "C:\Program Files\SeleniumServer\selenium-remote-control-1.0.1\selenium-server-1.0.1\selenium-server.jar"</span> but after reading <a href="http://community.codesmithtools.com/blogs/tdupont/archive/2008/12/16/automated-testing-w-selenium.aspx">this article</a> I changed my project to use the <span class="code">SeleniumTestBase</span> code example which allows me to use the <span class="code">firefoxProfileTemplate</span> argument to tell firefox which profile to run under. All of my tests now inherit from SeleniumTestBase and the selenium server starts as part of the test which feels a lot cleaner.  Oh, and the tests over the self-verified SSL certificate work too.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-1171228443365319186?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
