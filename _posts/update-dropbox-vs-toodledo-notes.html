      I wrote the other day about my quandary about where to store my notes in my blog post <div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/dropbox-vs-toodledo-notes">Dropbox vs Toodledo notes</a></div>

<p>I decided to move over to dropbox, as it makes it much easier to edit them from a laptop/desktop machine, its just as easy on the iPhone, and they will all be in one place.  In the end I simplified my criteria and bought <a href="http://notesy-app.com">notesy</a>, a nicely designed app, with excellent customer <a href="http://notesy-app.com/support/">support</a> - I emailed my criteria and within a couple of hours had a detailed list of what it could currently do, what there were plans to do, and the offer to refund if my external keyboard didn't work properly.</p>

<p>Almost all of my notes are now transferred over, and I'll soon be able to de-install another app.  Productivity win!</p>
