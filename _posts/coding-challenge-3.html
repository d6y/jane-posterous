Today, Mark and I announced the winner of the 3rd <a href="http://www.madgex.com">Madgex</a> Coding Challenge.  This coding challenge was announced on the 3rd June and entries needed to be in on the 30th June.  The email announcement said:<br /><blockquote>So, the challenge this time is all around compression.<p />Take a string, compress it into a byte[], record the size, decompress it.<p />You can use any algorithm you chose, but it must be coded by you and not included from an external library<p />I have defined an Interface ICompress as follows:<p /><span class="code">public interface ICompress<br />{<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/// &lt;summary&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/// Take a string and convert it into a byte[]<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/// &lt;/summary&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/// &lt;param name="source"&gt;The string to be converted&lt;/param&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/// &lt;returns&gt;The converted byte[]&lt;/returns&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;byte[] Compress(string source);<p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/// &lt;summary&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/// Take the bytearray produced by the call to Compress, and decompress it<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/// &lt;/summary&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/// &lt;param name="compressedData"&gt;The data to be decompressed&lt;/param&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/// &lt;returns&gt;The string&lt;/returns&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;string DeCompress(byte[] compressedData);<br />}</span><p />I have provided a solution with the interface (Interface), a console app (CodingChallenge3) and an implementation of the interface (Compressor) (which just converts from string to byte[] and back again, no compression) on the development file share.<p />The source string is provided through the app.config file of the CodingChallenge3 project (the console app).<p />What do you need to submit?<br />- A Compressor project that I can plug in to the provided solution<br />- A couple of paragraphs explaining how your algorithm works</blockquote><p />We had 4 solutions submitted, and they were all of a really high standard.  I tested them with 6 different input scenarios:<br />- The original provided sample - the text for "Mary had a little lamb"<br />- An empty string - which caused a few exceptions to be raised<br />- A single space <br />- A string of numbers<br />- The contents of <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2600">war and peace</a><br />- The contents of <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1257">the 3 musketeers</a> in French<p />Each sample was run through each person's solution, and the most compressed result won that round.  In the end, one person won 2 rounds (having implemented their own algorithm) and one won 4 rounds (having implemented 3 different methods and selected the one with the highest compression).<p />This was based around <a href="http://forum.lessthandot.com/viewtopic.php?f=102&amp;t=3086">Puzzle 16: Zip me up, Buttercup</a> from the great resource <a href="http://blogs.lessthandot.com/index.php/ITProfessionals/EthicsIT/collection-of-puzzles-for-programmers">Collection Of Puzzles For Programmers</a> <p />Previous coding challenges have been based loosely on <a href="http://forum.lessthandot.com/viewtopic.php?f=102&amp;t=1938">LTD Puzzle 4: Finding Prime Numbers</a> (which was Madgex coding challenge 1) and <a href="http://forum.lessthandot.com/viewtopic.php?f=102&amp;t=1821">LTD Puzzle 3: ASCII Art Shapes</a> (Madgex coding challenge 2).<p />I'm delighted with how these are going, and the interest and general communication that they generate - lots of discussion, hints of secrecy, and comparisons between each other - and then lots of discussion once the results have been announced, and the code is available for scrutiny.  So, I'm now busy thinking up ideas for Madgex Coding Challenge 4 - if anyone has any suggestions or resources for me to use, please pop them in the comments<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-4560578699490057381?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
