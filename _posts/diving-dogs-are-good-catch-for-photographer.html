<p>Before the photos spread across the world, <a href="http://littlefriendsphoto.com/">Casteel</a> was doing okay as a freelance photographer. He sometimes struggled to pay the bills, but his list of clients was growing. He was actually on a shoot for Animal Planet when the photos first started to get around.</p>
<p>Now everything has changed. On that fateful February 9th, the photos mysteriously landed on Reddit, Facebook, Google+ and then Warholian, becoming one of the hottest trends amongst viewers on at least five or six continents.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 people all over the world have subsequently asked him to shoot photos of their pets. He&rsquo;s got a line of publishing houses fighting to get the rights to his forthcoming book of underwater dog photos, and he&rsquo;s made appearance on, or in, most major American news publications from the <em>The New York Times</em> to <em>Good Morning America</em>.</p>

<p>I was one of the many that blogged <a href="http://www.littlefriendsphoto.com/index2.php#/home/">Seth Casteel</a>'s underwater dog photography skills. I find it really interesting to read what impact the exposure has had to Seth, and it makes me wonder if there are more stories out there of the impact that things "going viral" have had on people (as opposed to brands)</p>
