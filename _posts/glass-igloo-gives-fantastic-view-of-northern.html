<p>We visited friends yesterday afternoon and were reminiscing about our shared <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/1999/08/hungary/">trip to Hungary to watch the solar eclipse of 1999</a> and discussing what other natural phenomena there were we could watch (they're keen to head off to the US in 2017 to take their 2 sons to the solar eclipse there) and someone mentioned the Northern Lights. I've long been fascinated with them, and they've been on my "one day I'd like to" list for many a year. And then, this morning, I was catching up on my RSS feed, and there was a link to this.</p>
<blockquote>The Igloo Village at <a href="http://www.kakslauttanen.fi/en/">Hotel Kakslauttanen</a> is guaranteed to give guests an amazing view of the Aurora Borealis during the winter months.
<p>The Igloo Village provides a one of a kind opportunity to admire the northern lights and millions of stars of the crystal clear sky, from the warmth and comfort of your own private glass igloo.</p>
<p>Built from a special thermal glass, the temperature inside the igloo always stays at a comfortable level. It also prevents the glass from not getting white frosted, hence keeping the view clear even when the temperature outside drops to under -30&deg;C. Every igloo is equipped with a toilet and luxury beds.</p>

<p>A very timely coincidence.</p>
