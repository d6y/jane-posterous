<p>I use <a href="http://www.toodledo.com">toodledo</a> to manage my todo list, and this works fine, except that it means I have my browser open all the time and don't really plan my days too well being a bit more reactive than proactive.  A few weeks ago I stumbled across a <a href="http://twitter.com/CAMURPHY/status/1875364732">tweet</a> from <a href="http://www.craigmurphy.com/">Craig Murphy</a> linking to the ebook version of a (very well written) <a href="http://www.pomodoro-book.com/">Pomodoro manual</a> (Pomodoro being a time mangement system).   I've been using the <a href="http://www.markforster.net/do-it-tomorrow/">Do It Tomorrow</a> technique with toodledo, but haven't really embraced the daily system.  Combining the two looks like it'll work well for me, allowing me to focus on what I need to do each day, whilst still recording other items (tomorrow and beyond) in toodledo.<p />I also recently stumbled across the <a href="http://www.pocketmod.com/">PocketMod</a> books from paper concept, and have been using a simple one as my work week planner for the last couple of weeks.  Today I went one stage further and used <a href="http://natbat.net/2009/May/21/pocketbooks/">Natalie's Pocket Project html/css work</a> to create a Pocket Pomodoro template for myself to use.<p />It has a week view on the front page - so I can put known appointments in there, allowing me to carry my calendar around the office with me.  And then 5 pages of todos, one per week day with an Unplanned and Urgent section to note down extra items.  I haven't put any checkboxes in as the number of pomodoros taken to fulfill a task will dictate this.  There is an Activity Inventory page, to put any of the items that appear that are not do it today urgent - these will be put into toodledo at an opportune moment.  Finally there is a notes page, to jot down anything that comes up during my week.  Over time, as I use this more, this may become a second Activity Inventory page, so watch this space.<p />As with Natalie's example, it only works on Webkit based browsers so I've also created it as a <a href="http://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0B_AkC4ZdTI9tOGVlZTFhYTItZjQ1OS00MjgyLWJiNDAtYWQ1YWMzOTlhYmZj&amp;hl=en_GB">PDF</a> for anyone who is interested in using this but isn't using a webkit based browser.<p />And of course, once you've got your PocketMod printed, you'll need to fold it, and this YouTube video does a great job of explaining how to do that <br />
