So, are you designing a social site where exclamation marks and less formal language is acceptable - if there is an error message is an "<a href="http://twitter.com/thispagedoesntexist">oops</a>" page acceptable - or are you designing a banking site in which case a fuller explanation indicating which part of your transaction did or didn't happen rather than leaving you wondering what just happened.  This got me thinking, every time I've worked on a web site, I, as the developer, have always written the error messages.  Generally this is the only copy I ever write for a website, and yet in some instances it is the most important.  Something for me to work on in the future.<p />As usual, the food at the Eagle was great, and there was a really good bunch of people there including some new faces.
