Last week I checked <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> and discovered the <a href="http://www.tweeterr.com/gallery/fail.php?failurl=/tweetimages/twitterfail02.jpg">Twitter is currently down for database maintenance</a> page.  As usual I felt a sense of mild frustration.  But, I also appreciated that it was a fun page, and that it did make me smile, slightly.  I thought about the other Twitter fail pages - the <a href="http://www.tweeterr.com/gallery/fail.php?failurl=/tweetimages/twitterfail01.jpg">fail whale</a> and the <a href="http://www.tweeterr.com/gallery/fail.php?failurl=/tweetimages/twitterfail03.jpg">Something is technically wrong</a> page and again appreciated their simplicity.  <p />So, for a bit of a giggle, I registered <a href="http://www.tweeterr.com/">tweeterr.com</a> and created a very simple site with a very simple aim - to make the twitter fail pages available all the time, even when Twitter is alive and well.<p /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<p />It is very simple, just a few pages, with the <a href="http://www.tweeterr.com/">homepage</a> displaying a random fail page, a <a href="http://www.tweeterr.com/gallery/">gallery</a> displaying them all, and a page showing the last 20<a href="http://www.tweeterr.com/status/"> twitter status messages</a>.<p />As with most of the projects I do at home, it is written in PHP, and as with the other RSS aggregation pages  I've used <a href="http://richardjameskendall.com/">Richard James Kendall</a>'s PHP RSS Reader.  Using a set of technologies I was familiar with meant that it went from being an idea on Tuesday morning, to being alive and working with all the functionality I wanted by Thursday evening.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-1332573812773782024?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
