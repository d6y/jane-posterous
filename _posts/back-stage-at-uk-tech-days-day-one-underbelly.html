    <p>I was at the <a href="//www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-">Visual Studio 2010</a> launch event as part of Microsoft's <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/uk/techdays/daydev.aspx">UK Tech Days</a> yesterday. In the tea break after the keynote speech, I was interviewed by <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/saraallison/">Sara Allison</a> (primarily because I was one of the few females in the audience).  I'm at around 2 minutes in. I'll post about the day itself later.</p></div>
