Sadly, the photograph was very quickly removed by popular vote.<br /> <span></span><br /> Here are some of the criticisms the voters had:</p><blockquote class="posterous_short_quote"><p>When everything is blurred you cannot convey the motion of the bicyclist. On the other hand, if the bicyclist is not the subject– what was?</p></blockquote><blockquote class="posterous_short_quote"><p>Why is the staircase so “soft”? Camera shake?

If this is a planned shot, it just didn’t come out right. If you can round up Mario, I would do it again. This time put the camera on a tripod and use the smallest aperture possible to get the best DoF. What I would hope for is that the railings are sharp and that mario on the bike shows a blur. Must have the foreground sharp, though. Without that, the image will never fly.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="posterous_short_quote"><p>yeah and? grey, blurry, small, odd crop</p></blockquote><blockquote class="posterous_short_quote"><p>bit too blurred to be worth a save from me</p></blockquote><blockquote class="posterous_short_quote"><p>Fantastic composition, but the tones and the graininess keep the photo from being great.</p></blockquote><p>What’s funny about this story is that Rabelo had the last laugh — the photograph is actually “Hyeres, France, 1932″, a famous photograph by the French photographer and “father of modern photojournalism”, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Cartier-Bresson">Henri Cartier-Bresson</a>. Made in 1932, the photo <a href="http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5056705">sold at auction in 2008</a> for a whopping $265,000.</p><p>This just goes to show that you shouldn’t let anonymous online critics dictate how you photograph. While it’s great to receive feedback and certainly worthwhile to hear things that help you improve your technique, the criticisms you hear online are often from people who don’t know what they’re talking about, so don’t give <em>too</em> much weight to negative comments!</p></blockquote>

    <p>This article made me smile. Submit a Henri Cartier-Bresson to a forum and get a less-than-favourable response then share it and make people look bad. I am pleased that I recognised it as a Cartier-Bresson and so guessed what the story was going to be. But all it really shows is that people in that forum don't have a knowledge of the history of photography, and different people appreciate different things, i.e. photography is subjective (which I believe it is). Interesting experiment though.</p></div>
