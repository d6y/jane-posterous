<a href="http://blogs.conchango.com/jamiethomson/default.aspx">Jamie Thomson</a> has an article about <a href="http://blogs.conchango.com/jamiethomson/archive/2006/08/04/4311.aspx">Improving the debugging in Katmai</a> (the new SQL Server version) by making requests via <a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Connect</a>.<p />I hadn't heard of Microsoft Connect before, but it seems like a great idea:<br /><i>By submitting feedback, you can actively work with members of the Microsoft product team to identify and evaluate the importance of issues, recommend workarounds, and help ensure that the product is reliable and meets customer needs. Your feedback can take the form of a suggestion for improving product design or behavior, or a description of a problem that interferes with your work or causes the product to behave unexpectedly.</i><p />You can submit feedback, or vote and add comments to existing requests.  I've voted on a couple of SSIS issues (as mentioned in Jamie's blog), <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/SQLServer/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=126239">Use breakpoints in&nbsp;script components</a> and <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/SQLServer/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=176232">Use breakpoints in&nbsp;script tasks that are in an eventhandler</a> as these both caused me problems last week.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-115495851109879703?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
