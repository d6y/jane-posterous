<p>Tonight I've had the pleasure of attending the second <a href="http://blog.clickclickjim.com/2010/08/18/miniclick1/">MiniClick Photography</a> talk, again held at <a href="http://www.addcolour.co.uk/">Add the Colour</a>. &nbsp;This month's was with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amooseabroad/">Kris Mitchell</a>&nbsp;who talked us through his voyage into photography and his experiences learning about portraiture and lighting via a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amooseabroad/sets/72157605412159990/">365</a> project, a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amooseabroad/sets/72157623135414240/">52 week</a> project and the concept of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amooseabroad/tags/payitforward/">paying it forward</a> - taking photos of the "p<span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px;">eople who serve the community and probably don't get as much recognition as they should" (taken from Kris's flickr description)</span>.</p>

<p>My key takeaways were:</p>
<ul>
<li>have courage to ask people if you can take their photo - they might even say Yes</li>
<li>think about the process of getting to your perfect photography - don't be too quick to dismiss the ones that didn't make it, Kris has a lot of contact sheet photographs which show the evolution of a shoot, i.e. from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amooseabroad/4302439551/in/set-72157623135414240/">this</a>, to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amooseabroad/4301486714/in/set-72157623135414240/">this</a>, with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amooseabroad/4303188424/in/set-72157623135414240/">this lighting</a>&nbsp;in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amooseabroad/4302428479/in/photostream/">this configuration</a></li>
<li>don't feel too bad if a project doesn't work out - just make sure you learn from it</li>
</ul>
<p>I've enjoyed the two talks I've seen as part of this series so far (<a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/miniclick-photography-talk-with-alex-bamford">read about the last one here</a>), and plan to make attending them a regular occasion. &nbsp;Jim is currently looking for more volunteers to talk next year, and is especially interested in hearing from female photographers. &nbsp;So, <a href="http://blog.clickclickjim.com/">get in touch with him</a> if you're interested.</p>
