<p>As I <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/october-10th-a-most-auspicious-day">mentioned a month or so ago</a> I planned (and did) take part in the 101010 photography project.</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>As I mention in the explanation of the photo: <br />I originally wanted to do something relevant to the day here in Sussex. I tried to take photos of the turning colours of leaves against the glorious blue sky, but I didn't really like any of them. So instead I went with a view upwards through a stave of power cables and into the deep blue beyond spotted whilst out walking the countryside with husband and dog.</p>
