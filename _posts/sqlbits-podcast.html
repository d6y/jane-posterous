The <a href="http://www.craigmurphy.com/podcasts/030-SQLBits-Jane-Dallaway-Jim-Shilling.mp3">interview</a> that Jim and I recorded with <a href="http://www.craigmurphy.com/content/">Craig Murphy</a> is now <a href="http://www.craigmurphy.com/blog/?p=729">up on his site</a>.<p />The photo I took of Craig was truly awful and so didn't make it into the public domain.  Sorry Craig!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-2485303331692403837?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
