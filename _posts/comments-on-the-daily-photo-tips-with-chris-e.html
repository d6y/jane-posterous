<p>I'm a recent subscriber to the <a href="http://dailyphototipswithchris.com/">Daily Photo Tips with Chris</a> podcast, and listened to the <a href="http://files.posterous.com/dptwc/MIU4dwxoxzNgxZYdzakaydANOJMj4oykWut6iXxxXvG6OzGweZmwfGPK2mY7/Card_Reader.mp3?AWSAccessKeyId=1C9REJR1EMRZ83Q7QRG2&amp;Expires=1252863034&amp;Signature=NsZxgUMwnTdk5upc%2BKnAG5uCRkI%3D">Camera or Card Reader</a> edition the other day and wanted to add my thoughts to it.<p />In addition to Chris's reason to use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_card_reader">card reader</a> rather than camera to transfer images - which was primarily speed of transfer - I have a few more</p>
<ul>
<li>preserving the safety of my camera - having the camera tethered to my laptop by a cable adds something to get caught - resulting in a (admittedly small) risk that my camera or my laptop ends up on the floor.  Well, I say it is small, but it is something that I've done which resulted in the camera having to be sent away for repair.  Not something I want to repeat</li>
<li>when shooting an event a card reader can be uploading photos on to a laptop whilst the camera, with a different card in it, can still be in use.  Additionally, if you find yourself with an assistant, this is a job that can be delegated</li>
<li>battery preservation - although my <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/kit-bag-nikon-d80">d80</a> battery lasts a long time, every transfer of images uses power</li>
</ul>
<p>The final recommendation is the same, get a good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Serial_Bus#USB_2.0">USB2</a> card reader and use that for image transfer.  In fact, as I write this, I have a <a href="http://www.sandisk.com/products/readers-accessories/micromate-sdhc.aspx">SanDisk MicroMate</a> attached to my laptop transferring images.</p>
