I found a link to <a href="http://www.jigzone.com">jigzone</a> over the holidays and decided to give it a go today.  So, I took one of my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157611165023602/">Lego Santa</a> photos, uploaded it to their server and generated a 48 piece classic jigsaw.  There are quite a lot of different options, like <a href="http://www.jigzone.com/puzzles/C3140EA739F?z=32&amp;m=33250A4024.7EC0A43">240 piece classic</a> and <a href="http://www.jigzone.com/puzzles/C3140EA739F?z=27&amp;m=33250A4024.7EC0A43">91 piece lizards</a> but I figured I'd stick with a simple-ish 48 pieces.<p /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<p />This isn't something I can see me doing very often, but it was a fun way to spend a few minutes<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-2688738936423601479?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
