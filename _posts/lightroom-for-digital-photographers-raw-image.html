The <a href="http://www.thedigitalphotographyconnection.com/LFDP.php">Lightroom for Digital Photographers</a> videocast covered an interesting and illustrative topic this week <a href="http://www.thedigitalphotographyconnection.com/LFDP_player.php?ID=57">What's the benefit of RAW images?</a>.  This is discussed within the context of <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/labels/lightroom.html">Lightroom</a>, but does indicate the extra information that is stored in a RAW image against a JPG image by looking into white balance options and colour depth.   <p />A good tutorial to watch if you've ever wondered what the RAW vs JPG fuss is all about.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-6538528220540653820?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
