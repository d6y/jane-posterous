<p>Thanks to <a href="http://last.fm/">last.fm</a> and the ability to auto-scrobble from iTunes/iPod/iPhone, I know that the following were my "Top" lists for 2010</p>
<p><strong>Top Artists</strong></p>

<p>I love last.fm, the fact it records this information for <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/JaneDallaway">me</a>, uses this to make recommendations, and lets me have access to a set of <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/JaneDallaway/neighbours">neighbours</a>,&nbsp;people with similar music tastes to me - which is how I discovered some of the artists who made it into my list, is wonderful. &nbsp;It takes very little effort for me to get this information, and leads to me finding new music to listen to. &nbsp;What's not to love.</p>
