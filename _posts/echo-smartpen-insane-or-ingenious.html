<p>Earlier today I found myself in a PC World for the first time in at least a year. I found it quite an interesting experience, seeing what was being sold as consumer grade hardware/software. Amongst the things I spotted, that I hadn't really noticed before was the <a href="http://www.livescribe.com/en-us/smartpen/echo/">Echo smartpen</a>.</p>

<p>This is a pen that records what you write and what you/others say and synchronises the two inputs together with it later being able to be transferred via USB to a computer for later reviewing via searchable&nbsp;<a href="http://www.livescribe.com/en-us/pencasts/">pencasts</a>. It also comes with the ability to download <a href="http://www.livescribe.com/en-us/smartpen/apps.html">apps</a> - like wikipedia, a translator and even a <a href="http://www.livescribe.com/store/20100120001/zork-1/p-549.htm">text based adventure game</a>.&nbsp;The bit that struck me as sheer genius, at least in an on-going revenue way, is that there are specialist items of stationery that accompany it. Pictured below are some of the items that PC World stocked - A4 and A5 notebooks, and post-its (there were also ink refils and cases too). These differ only in that they have pre-printed "buttons" on the pages, showing things like record, stop, pause, navigation etc and that they can be used to create diagrams/grids/"buttons" that interact with the apps that are running - for instance drawing a grid to play tic tac toe on.</p>

<p>I can't help wondering if there was a way some of this functionality could be built into something like the <a href="http://www.trustedreviews.com/wacom-bamboo-stylus-for-ipad_Gadget_review">wacom bamboo stylus</a> - adding another dimension to iPad/other tablet device usage. Also, wondering how something like this works in conjunction with news reports about <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2011/jul/14/children-signing-name-with-x">the demise of the teaching of handwriting in US States</a>.</p>
<p>I have to admit that I'm intrigued by this. I don't want one, as I love writing with my Grandad's <a href="http://www.parker51.com/">Parker 51</a> fountain pen and I'm unlikely to be tempted away from that experience any time soon. But I'm intrigued, and as the title of the blog post indicates, I can't work out whether this is an insane idea, or an ingenious one.</p>
