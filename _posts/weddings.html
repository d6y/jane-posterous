<p>I've had the pleasure to attend 2 weddings in the last 3 weeks.  On both occasions I was a guest with a camera, and so having read the chapters on weddings in both <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/40-Digital-SLR-Techniques-Go/dp/9810535201/ref=sr_1_1/202-3356570-6061414?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1186514165&amp;sr=8-1">40 Digital SLR Techniques</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Digital-Photography-Book-Scott-Kelby/dp/032147404X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/202-3356570-6061414?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1186514193&amp;sr=8-1">The Digital Photography Book</a> I was ready to take my chances and see what I could get.  <p />The first wedding was <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157600969945515/">Sarah and Mat</a>.  Part way through the speeches Millie (their little girl) found her reflection in the bar and I managed to get this photo.  I managed to get it processed and printed out before we headed home the following day and so framed it and gave it to them as an extra wedding present.<p />The second wedding was Ash and Mitul.  I haven't finished processing the wedding photos yet, but I have managed to work my way through the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157600969945515/">pre-wedding Dinner photos</a>.  The wedding itself was bright and colourful - with lots of sari's and other indian outfits on display, so I'm looking forward to seeing what I've captured.</p>
