<p>Last summer I <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/remember-the-milk-73&quot;">posted </a> about <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember The Milk</a>.  Well, here I am 6 months on and I'm still using it, constantly.  If I think of something I add it via whichever interface is closest - <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">web</a>, <a href="http://m.rememberthemilk.com/">mobile</a>, sms via <a href="http://twitter.com/">twitter</a> - and I no longer have a reliance on scraps of paper, or a notebook with scribbles all over it.  I think that it is the number of different ways to enter a task, update a task list, review what needs to be done that makes this tool so valuable to me.  Especially seeing as how I have a laptop at work, a different laptop at home, I have 2 different mobile phones (one work, one personal), a notebook/log book for work stuff - keeping a list on any one of them just wouldn't work for me without me having to make notes somewhere else as well - I know, I've tried it before.<p />So, yesterday, I decided it was time to support them, so I upgraded to the <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/upgrade/">pro membership</a>.   And it wasn't because I wanted the extra functionality (although I'm sure I'll make use of the <a href="http://i.rememberthemilk.com/">iPhone/iPod Touch interface</a>) but it was because I realised how much I rely on their service, and how much I'd miss it if it wasn't around.  So, for $25 for a year, I figured it was worth it for the feel good factor of supporting them.</p>
