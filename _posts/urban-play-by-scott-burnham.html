    <p><a href="http://scottburnham.com/">Scott Burhnam</a> was one of the speakers at <a href="http://thestory.org.uk/">The Story</a> on Friday. As with many of the speakers, I'd not seen any of his work before, and found the whole <a href="http://scottburnham.com/urbanplay/">Urban Play</a> project rather wonderful. But, especially this part of the project - 250,000 euro cent pieces used to spell out "obsessions make my life worse and my work better" all done with the knowledge that it would be "perfect" for only a short while before the coins got rearranged/redistributed. Lovely!</p></div>
