<p><a href="http://www.barcampbrighton.org/">Barcamp Brighton</a> 2 is coming soon - March 15th and 16th 2008 - and is going to be held at the University Campus at Falmer in the Union building.  It sounds like its going to be able to be a larger affair than the <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/tag/barcampbrighton">last one</a> which will be excellent, but unfortunately I'm not going to be able to make this one. I'm a bit sorry about this but we've already committed to be somewhere else at a gathering in advance of a wedding a bit later in the year.  I'm sure BarcampBrighton 2 will be great and I look forward to keeping up with updates via twitter, <a href="http://flickr.com/search/?q=barcampbrighton&amp;w=all">flickr</a> and various attendees blogs and wish the organisers lots of luck.</p>
