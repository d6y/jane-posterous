<p>I've been doing quite a bit of background reading about eBooks, pricing and the like over the weekend, and found a few interesting extracts in articles that I thought I'd dump here so I can find them again...</p>
<p><strong>About pricing</strong></p>
<div>
<p>From the article <a href="http://www.ebookmagazine.co.uk/interview-txtrs-andrew-rhomberg/2010864">Andrew Rhomberg talks txtr</a> in <a href="http://www.ebookmagazine.co.uk/">eBook Magazine</a></p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>A common complaint is that eBook prices are too expensive compared with paper books &ndash; do you think this is a fair criticism and what needs to happen before eBook prices come down?<p />The savings to publishers, retailers and other stakeholders that result form a digital transition are real, but not as large as consumers think. After all, it can cost as little as 10% of the cover price to print a best-seller. Thus the savings in print cost arising from an ebook might only be 10%. On the other hand eBooks attract 17.5% VAT, while physical books are zero rated for purposes of VAT (at least in the UK).</p>

<p>and</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">
<p>The only major difference between the UK and US is that in the UK we tax eBooks more heavily than physical books, which is nonsense.</p>

<p><strong>About the life of an eBook vs a book, piracy, lending etc</strong></p>
<p>From the article <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/adrianhon/100005867/your-time-is-up-publishers-book-piracy-is-about-to-arrive-on-a-massive-scale/">Your time is up, publishers. Book piracy is about to arrive on a massive scale</a> amongst the <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/">Telegraph Technology Blog</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>After Christmas, tens of millions of people will have the motive, the means, and the opportunity to perform book piracy on a massive scale. It won&rsquo;t happen immediately, but it will happen. It&rsquo;ll begin with people downloading electronic copies of books they already own, just for convenience&rsquo;s sake (and hey, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/04/magazine/04FOB-ethicist-t.html?_r=2">the New York Times says it&rsquo;s ethical!</a>). This will of course handily introduce them to the world of ebook torrents.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2010/10/steal_book">Steal this book: The loan arranger</a> by <a href="http://www.economist.com">The Economist</a></p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">
<p>If you own a physical book, in much of the world you may sell it, lend it&mdash;even burn or bury it. You may also keep the book forever.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>With a physical book, the afterlife of a disposable read is to hand it off to another party: a library sale, a friend or relative, or the free bin outside a used bookstore. Such books are also purchased in the millions and sold for one penny plus shipping online partly as a marketing effort by booksellers who can then include their own catalogs with each sale. An e-book, however, lives in limbo. Neither moving on to the next life, nor returning to this one, it can never be freed.</p>
