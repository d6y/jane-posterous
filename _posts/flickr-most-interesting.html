When reading the <a href="http://blog.flickr.net/en">flickr blog</a> earlier I spotted a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cmichel67/84146617/in/set-72157600042547465/">beautiful penguin photo</a>, amongst a post about tomorrow (Sunday 15th June) being <a href="http://blog.flickr.net/en/2008/06/13/capturing-mother-nature-nature-photography-day-is-june-15th/">Nature Photography Day</a>, and being a penguin fan I took a closer look.  <p /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

So, I took a look at the set generator, and created my own <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157605601039214/">Most Interesting</a> set.  I've set it to show my 24 <a href="http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/">most interesting</a> photos, and to refresh once a day.<p />Based on this set, my current most interesting photograph is this one:<br /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
