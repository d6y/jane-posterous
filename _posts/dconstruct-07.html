<p>Richard attended the <a href="http://2005.dconstruct.org/">first dConstruct</a>, we were out of the country for last years  (although I was an <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/dconstruct-2006-podcast">avid</a> <a href="http://2007.dconstruct.org/podcast/">podcast</a> listener) and I'm really pleased to have a ticket for this years event.  It was impressive to see the speed with which the tickets sold yesterday - I think it was in the region of 6 hours.  That's pretty impressive and goes to show that the <a href="http://www.clearleft.com/">ClearLeft</a> guys have really hit a sweet spot in the conference market.</p>
