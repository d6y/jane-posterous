On Thursday myself and Dave (the Madgex DBA) headed off to the Microsoft offices in Victoria to attend the<a href="http://www.sqlserverfaq.com/"> SQL Server User Group</a> meeting which was the launch event for SQL Server 2008.<p /> There were 2 key speakers (blurb taken from an email from SQL Server User Group):<ul><li>Jasper Smith did the first stint on Admin stuff. He’s been an MVP for quite a while and has until recently been working at Nationwide. His blog can be found <a href="http://sqlblogcasts.com/blogs/sqldbatips">here</a>  and his website <a href="http://www.sqldbatips.com">here</a>. He’s got some great utilities like server manager for vista and Reporting Services scripter.</li><li>Simon Sabin did the last session on dev stuff. He is also an MVP and is a freelance consultant and works as part of SQL Know How and SQL Skills. His blog can be found <a href="http://sqlblogcasts.com/blogs/SimonS">here</a>.</li></ul><a href="http://siliconbea.ch/">Bruce</a> posted a link to the Dev Team earlier this week which covers a lot of the same ground, <a href="http://angryhacker.com/blog/archive/2008/06/20/10-reasons-why-sql-server-2008-is-going-to-rock.aspx">10 reasons why SQL Server 2008 is going to rock</a>, and so I'm going to use this as a starter and just supplement it with the additional areas covered.<ul><li>Database encryption – another enterprise only tool.  You can now encrypt a database against a user defined key (stored as a certificate on the filing system).  This will also result in tempdb being encrypted.  When encrypted the mdf and ldf files are also encrypted, as are backups.</li><li>Debugging has improved in the Management studio, can debug through a series of statements not just stored procedures.</li><li>Using Inline variable assignment you can use a rowset to insert multiple data items in one line – Insert into  values (1), (2), (3) – at the back end this gets translated into a union statement (see more <a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/community/blogs/andras/archive/2008/02/28/44645.aspx">here</a>).</li><li>Merge is introduced (finally) – see <a href="http://sqlblogcasts.com/blogs/simons/archive/tags/MERGE/default.aspx">here</a> for some posts about it.  But the short version is the ability to do<br /><span class="code">Merge Into <br />Using <br />When matched then<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Update set<br />When target not matched then<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Insert</span><br />Basically doing an insert and update in one statement.  Merge is deterministic, and appears to be quicker but mileage may vary.</li><li>CLR now handles larger data types (> 8000 bytes)</li></ul>Another good evening, this time complete with pizza and beer.<br /><em>Update</em>: <a href="http://sqlblogcasts.com/blogs/simons/">Simon</a> has posted a <a href="http://sqlblogcasts.com/blogs/simons/archive/2008/06/19/Usergroup-meeting-follow-up-post.aspx">follow-up containing the answers to questions he didn't get time to answer</a>.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-106862972536995119?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
