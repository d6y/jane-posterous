<p>Today, I had my first afternoon off as part of my newly reduced hours to help my "Get Inspired, Learn Stuff, Photograph more" mission post holiday and dConstruct. &nbsp;As it is <a href="http://www.bpb.org.uk/">BPB</a> and there are loads of exhibitions to go and see, I thought that this was an excellent way to spend it. &nbsp;So, I did. &nbsp;I'd planned to see 5 exhibitions, and instead, I think managed to cram in 7.</p>
<p>So, in chronological order, I saw:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.bpb.org.uk/exhibitions/9359/bpb-curated-queer-brighton/">Queer Brighton</a> at <a href="http://www.lighthouse.org.uk/">Lighthouse</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.photofringe.org/?p=213">Night Trees</a> at <a href="http://www.iogallery.co.uk/">IO Gallery</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.photofringe.org/?p=165">In Site</a> at <a href="http://www.bluedoggallery.co.uk/">Bluedog Gallery</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.photofringe.org/?p=100">Bright Nights</a> at <a href="http://compartment.org.uk/">CompARTment</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.photofringe.org/?p=112">Closer</a> at <a href="http://www.phoenixbrighton.org/">Phoenix Brighton</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.photofringe.org/?p=1219">Transmission</a> at the Post Office Foyer in the Old Coop Building</li>
<li><a href="http://www.photofringe.org/?p=1290">Girls UnScene</a> and <a href="http://www.photofringe.org/?p=181">Life is Stranger than fiction: Parallel Exhibitions</a> at <a href="http://www.addcolour.co.uk/">Add the Colour</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Amongst these are some very different exhibitions, ranging from a handful of photographs in the window of a gallery, to an installation in The Open Market, and including several more in a more traditional and standard format.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://bright-nights.co.uk/">Bright Nights</a> exhibition features work from <a href="http://www.jeanlucbrouard.com/">Jean-Luc Brouard</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.photoandre.com/">Andr&eacute; Lichtenberg</a>, <a href="http://www.andrewfordphotography.co.uk/">Andrew Ford</a> and <a href="http://www.alexbamford.com/">Alex Bamford</a>&nbsp;and features the kind of photography that appeals to me, after-dark, low light and moonlit photography, so it was an obvious choice for me to fit in. &nbsp;The installation is in a unit at The Open Market, and is a projection of photographs onto a screen which is viewed through holes in a shutter (see photo below). &nbsp;The photography is excellent, and well executed, and the installation is definitely worth a visit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I arrived at the Phoenix Gallery to take a look at Closer, Stuart Griffiths, the photographer was just finishing a talk to a group of students, so I stood around and listened, and heard some of the Q&amp;A part. &nbsp;His photography was pretty raw and moving, and is described on the Phoenix Gallery site as</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 10px; margin-left: 1px; border-left-width: 4px !important; border-left-style: solid !important; border-left-color: #dddddd !important; padding-left: 10px;">
<p>Closer&nbsp;is Griffiths&rsquo; first solo exhibition and includes two bodies of photographs: the first produced between 2003&ndash;2008, the second during the late 1980&rsquo;s and early 1990&rsquo;s. These photographs explore Griffiths&rsquo; personal feelings towards war and conflict, and respond to the unseen consequences of the ongoing campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a real stop and think exhibiton.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But probably the most impressive set of photographs for me, were those of <a href="http://jamiestoker.com/ ">Jamie Stoker</a>, amongst the <a href="http://transmissioncollective.tumblr.com/">Transmission</a> project in the Old Coop Building. &nbsp;I loved his <a href="http://jamiestoker.com/portfolios/43411-london">Bright Lights, Big City</a> series, finding the portraits to be beautiful, well lit and neatly composed, but it was the <a href="http://jamiestoker.com/portfolios/33991-park-life">Park Life</a> project that really impressed me. &nbsp;This project follows the idea of taking a portable studio set up out to Stanmer Park and taking portraits of the people he found, including both the temporary studio and the nature in the resulting photograph. &nbsp;They are just beautiful, and I would recommend taking a look at them.</p>

<p>Whilst wandering home I popped into Add the Colour to look at the exhibitions that I was too busy talking to really appreciate at <a href="http://www.bpb.org.uk/">last nights talk</a>. &nbsp;It really is a great place to stop, and while away an hour or two, talking to fellow photographers and for me to let my overloaded senses return to normal.</p>
