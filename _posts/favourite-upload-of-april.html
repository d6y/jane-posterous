    <p>In April I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/archives/date-posted/2010/04/calendar/">uploaded 216 photos</a></p><p>This photo was taken using hipstamatic (again!) with the John S lens and Blanko film and was taken in Bridlington, East Yorkshire of part of the recently <a href="http://www.eastriding.gov.uk/leisure/tourism/thespa/redevelopment.html">redeveloped</a> <a href="http://www.eastriding.gov.uk/leisure/tourism/thespa/index.html">spa</a> building.  I loved the orange colour, and knew that the blue cast of the John S lens would work really well with it.</p></div>
