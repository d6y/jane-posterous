<p>They lay forgotten in a drawer for 35 years, but Paul Trevor's joyous photographs of children in 1970s Liverpool are finally on display. The photographer recalls his time among the city's terraces and tower blocks, where he stumbled upon a now-vanished era of happiness and freedom</p>

<p>There are some wonderful looking images shown in this video. I'm now trying to work out if there is any chance of me making it to Liverpool before the end of September to visit the exhibition. Unlikely.</p>
