I belong to a blogroll of <a href="http://geekgirlblogs.com/">Geek Girl blogs</a> and subscribe to the <a href="http://www.geekgirlblogs.com/GirlTalk/tabid/55/moduleid/384/RSS.aspx">RSS feed</a>.  One post that caught my eye was <a href="http://www.thatcanadiangirl.co.uk/">VÃ©ro</a>'s post about her <a href="http://www.thatcanadiangirl.co.uk/blog/2008/01/05/blog-topic-challenge-a-topic-a-day-keeps-vero-busy/">Blog Topic Challenge</a>.  I left her a comment suggesting "How about a post about your favourite tools for helping you to get stuff done? Or your favourite gadgets? Or your regular RSS reads?".<p />She has responded with <a href="http://www.thatcanadiangirl.co.uk/blog/2008/01/09/blog-topic-challenge-favourite-tools-for-getting-things-done/">Favourite tools for getting things done</a> sharing <a href="http://osx.iusethis.com/user/thatcanadiangirl">her mac apps</a> via the site <a href="http://osx.iusethis.com/">iusethis</a>.  I hadn't spotted this site before, so I've been and set up a profile so that everyone can see <a href="http://osx.iusethis.com/user/janedallaway">what tools I use</a> as well.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-4271395186997759361?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
