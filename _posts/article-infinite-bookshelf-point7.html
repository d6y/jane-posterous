<p>So it will be with books. We pine after physical books, but our kids and their kids, well, who knows? Perhaps an aging early generation Kindle, plastic yellowing, reading surface scuffed, will ignite in them the same sensations of intellectual warmth? Or will their eyes tear up ever so slightly at the sight of the splash screen for Adobe Acrobat Reader?</p>

<p>At the <a href="http://www.makerfairebrighton.com/">Brighton mini Makers Faire</a> in September I spent some time looking at the BBC micro and had that tingle of familiarity. So, yes, it is possible that these devices, iPad, kindle, etc will produce a pang of recognition for children who spent a lot of time with them. My suspicion is that the iPhone and iPad will do that more than the kindle though.</p>
