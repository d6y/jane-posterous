So 2 weeks in at my <a href="http://www.madgex.com/">new job</a> and so far so good.<p />My first week was mainly an induction week.  My first couple of days I met with quite a lot of the Director's and Heads Of to get to know the history of Madgex, as well as an overview of what each department does.  I followed my induction plan of tasks to try out, and so spent time familiarising myself with the toolkit and the standard content management system.  My first week was also highly social, with a company night out on Thursday at <a href="http://www.yellowave.co.uk/">Yellowwave</a> for beach volleyball and a bbq, a Friday lunchtime pre-wedding drinks for the system analyst and then the evening at the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/glennjonesnet/312899303/">company pub</a> before heading off to move the <a href="http://twitter.com/home">twitter</a> crowd at <a href="http://www.nigelberman.co.uk/eatingout_theeagle.htm">The Eagle</a>.<p />This week started with a client meeting for the project I'm going to be working on for the next 3 or 4 months.  It is going to be a job board based on the <a href="http://www.madgex.com/products/jb_overview.html">Origin Job Board</a> but with some quite specific customisations and is going to be quite challenging in places.  It is going to be an ASP.NET and SQL Server 2005 project and will result in an <a href="http://www.madgex.com/products/jb_admin.html">admin site</a>, several <a href="http://www.madgex.com/products/jb_web_shots.html">front-end web sites</a> and a web service to upload jobs.  I'm sure I'll post more about it as I make progress.<p />Next week there is another new developer starting, so I won't be the newbie anymore :-)<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-4140103670128675659?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
