I decided to take a look at the MSDN Virtual Labs after finding this a good way to work on my ASP.NET course.  I figured I'd start off with the <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtuallabs.com/express/registration.aspx?LabId=b6ad601c-b5b1-45ba-976d-08a5ff9dd875">Express: What’s New in SQL Server 2005</a> lab and see how I got on.  This was a 30 minute lab, and I've got quite a bit out of it.  <p />I hadn't read anything about the new <a href="http://www.devx.com/dbzone/Article/28165">PIVOT and UNPIVOT</a> functionality, and by following up on that I discovered about the introduction of <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms190766.aspx">Common Table Expressions</a> which look like a much more elegant way of temporarily storing data for use within stored procedures etc.  This should give a lot more flexibility.<p />The other thing I knew about but hadn't seen examples of was the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms175976.aspx">TRY...CATCH</a> functionality.  This is a great addition, but it is a shame that it doesn't work with user defined functions as well.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-3172792544666899718?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
