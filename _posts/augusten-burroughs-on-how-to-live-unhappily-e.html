      <blockquote><p>The truth about healing is that <em>heal</em> is a television word. Someone close to you dies? You will never heal. What will happen is, for the first few days, the people around you will touch your shoulder and this will startle you and remind you to breathe. You will feel as though you will soon be dead from natural causes; the weight of the grief will be physical and very nearly unbearable. </p>
<p>Eventually, you will shower and leave the house. Maybe in a year you will see a movie. And one day somebody will say something and it will cause you to laugh. And you will clamp your hand over your mouth because you laughed and that laugh will break your heart, it will feel like a betrayal. How can you laugh?</p>
<p>In time, to your friends, you will appear to have recovered from your loss. All that really happened, you'll think, is that the hole in the center of your life has narrowed just enough to be concealed by a laugh. And yet, you might feel a pressure for it to be true. You might feel that "enough" time has passed now, that the hole at the center of you should not be there at all.</p>
<p>But holes are interesting things. As it happens, we human beings are able to live just fine with many holes of many sizes and shapes. Pleasure, love, compassion, fulfillment; these things do not leak out of holes of any size. So we can be filled with holes and loss and wide expanses of unhealed geography—and we can also be excited by life and in love and content at the exact same moment.</p>
<p>This is among the oldest, deepest, most primal truths: The facts of life may be, at times, unbearably painful. But the core, the bones of life are generous beyond all reason or belief. Those things which ought to kill us do not. This should be taken as encouragement to continue.</p>
<p>The truth about healing is that you don't need to heal to be whole. And by whole, I mean damaged, missing pieces of who you were, your heart—missing what feels like some of your most important parts. And yet, not missing any part of you at all. Being, in truth, larger than you were before.</p></blockquote><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304746604577379891905861390.html">online.wsj.com</a></div>
    <p>In the past 15 months I have found very few articles that even come close to expressing the range of emotions that the death of a loved one, in my case parent, can bring. This, for me, is one of the better ones. Part of the reason for posting it here, is so I can find it easily when either I need to revisit it's words and remind myself that it's all ok, or when I think someone I know may need to read it.</p></div>
