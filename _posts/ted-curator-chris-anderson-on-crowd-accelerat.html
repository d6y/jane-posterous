<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">
<blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><strong>Innovation</strong> has always been a group activity. The myth of the lone genius having a eureka moment that changes the world is indeed a myth. Most innovation is the result of long hours, building on the input of others. Ideas spawn from earlier ideas, bouncing from person to person and being reshaped as they go. If you&rsquo;re comfortable with the language of memes, you could say a healthy meme needs an ecosystem not of a single brain but of a network of brains. That&rsquo;s how ideas bump into other ideas, replicate, mutate, and evolve.</blockquote>
