Whilst I was on my pre-Christmas travels around the country, I caught up with some back issues of the <a href="http://www.bjphoto.co.uk/">British Journal of Photography</a>.  Among other useful articles, I was particularly taken with a <a href="http://www.bjphoto.co.uk/public/showPage.html?page=482952">review</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Gursky">Andreas Gursky</a>'s exhibition <a href="http://www.kunstmuseumbasel.ch/en/exhibitions/current/gursky/">At Large</a>, illustrated with an <a href="http://cereality.files.wordpress.com/2007/04/gursky-engadin.jpg">amazing photograph of skiers at the annual ski marathon in Engadin</a>.  <p />The exhibition is on at the <a href="http://kunstmuseumbasel.ch/">Kunstmuseum, Basel</a> until the 24th February and looks like it'll be amazing.  Here's hoping there will be an opportunity to see this exhibition in the UK at some point.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-2082792960516830940?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
