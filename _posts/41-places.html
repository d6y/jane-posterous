<p />On Thursday evening I had the pleasure of attending a book reading at Waterstones by <a href="http://nsblog.co.uk/wshaw">William Shaw</a>, and others, mainly from the book <a href="http://41places.org/book.html">41 places: 41 stories</a> written to accompany the <a href="http://41places.org/index.html">41 places</a> installation during the festival.  <p />In May I had just got my new camera, and needed an assignment.  The assignment I gave myself was to shoot <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/41places.html">every one</a> of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157600196281612/">41 places</a>.  This I managed, and duly added my photos to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/378103@N23/pool/">flickr group</a>.  <p />During the process I met and exchanged emails with William Shaw and so I was delighted when he asked to show some of my photos as a slideshow during Thursday's event.  They were displayed, amongst others including some of the installation process, for quite some time.  This is the first time I've seen any of my photographs projected during an event.  All in all rather pleasing.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-1494113329906549214?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
