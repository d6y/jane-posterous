A few days ago one of the <a href="http://www.brightonbloggers.com/">Brighton Blogger</a>s mentioned that the <a href="http://www.brightonbloggers.com/aggregated/">aggregated feed</a> didn't seem to have had any new content since July.  On investigation the provider I was using, <a href="http://groups.blogdigger.com/">blogdigger</a>, had stopped generating content so I needed a new solution.  I already have an <a href="http://www.brightonbloggers.com/brighton.opml">OPML</a> file which contains the list of the RSS feeds so this seemed like a good place to start.<p />I did a bit of a search to find a method, and thought about using <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">yahoo pipes</a>. After a bit of googling around I found an <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=ypEo0_zd2xGgEDTaJhOy0Q">Aggregated RSS feed from OPML</a> which seemed to be just the thing.  So I cloned it, simplified it and produced a<a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=f7dd07fa5dd1961408d7323cc42dcb46"> Brighton Bloggers aggregated feed</a>.<p />I've <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/person.info?eyuid=sF8qVKw5u2Wl0.5D6lJJE3_PxQA-">produced quite a few pipes</a>, and it continues to be a really useful tool.
