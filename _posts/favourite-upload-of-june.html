After a bit of consideration, I think this one is my favourite.<p />It was taken using my new Blackbird, Fly filled with a roll of the lovely (and rapidly becoming my default choice) Kodak Portra 400VC.  It was taken at Lancing and features Richard and Skitters.<p />The photo has had no post processing.  The film was processed and scanned by <a href="http://www.colourstream.net/">Colourstream</a> in Brighton.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-713000788497491599?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
