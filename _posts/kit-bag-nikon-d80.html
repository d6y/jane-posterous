<h1>The Camera</h1><br />My main camera is now the <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikond80/">Nikon d80 </a>(having upgraded from my <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/2007/03/kit-bag-g3.html">Canon G3</a>).  I've had it only 10 days or so, but so far <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/tags/d80">we're getting along just fine</a>.  I've experienced the same problem as many other d80 users - namely that it has a habit of overexposing (apparently it exposes for the blacks in the picture) but a quick adjustment on the exposure meter sorts that out.  Other than that, no problems at all.<p /><h1>The Accessories</h1><br /><h2>Lenses</h2><br />So far I have one lens - the <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0502/05021404sigma30dc.asp">Sigma 30mm f1.4</a> - fortunately I love it.  I wanted a fast lens for shooting some of the geek events I attend as light levels can be pretty variable.<br />I also have the <a href="http://www.purelygadgets.co.uk/showproduct.php?prodid=4270">Nikon AFS DX VR 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6G ED IF</a> on order.<br />Once I've got used to these lenses, I'll determine whether I need a more wide angle lens to add to collection.<p /><h2>Filters</h2><br />I have one filter for the Sigma lens (62mm) and that is a UV filter.  Over time, when I've worked out which lens I'm using in what circumstances I'll get a polarising, a Neutral Density and maybe some close up filters.  I already have a 72mm UV filter ready for when my 18-200mm lens shows up.<p /><h2>Accessories</h2><br />So far I have the following:<ul><br /><li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000BYCKU8/026-2949587-5417226/richarddallaway">spare battery</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00007EDZG/026-2949587-5417226/richarddallaway">Remote Control</a></li></ul><br /><h1>The Case</h1><br />I've used my non-camera <a href="http://www.ebags.co.uk/crumpler/aggott_shoulder_bag/product_detail/index.cfm?modelid=48233">Crumpler bag</a> a lot over the years, and it has just kept on going.  So, I thought I'd give the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Crumpler-Pretty-4000-Black-Orange/dp/B000KKO7YU/richarddallaway">Crumpler Pretty Boy 4000 XL</a> a try.  It looks fantastic, and fits everything I need (at the moment) into it without a problem.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-4076851127006566917?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
