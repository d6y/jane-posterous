    <p>I paid my first ever visit to the <a href="http://designmuseum.org/">Design Museum</a> yesterday, mainly to see the <a href="http://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/2011/kenneth-grange">Kenneth Grange - making Britain Modern</a> exhibition which I found fascinating. Whilst there I also popped upstairs to the <a href="http://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/2011/brit-insurance-designs-of-the-year">Brit Insurance Designs of the Year</a> exhibition which featured, amongst other things, the beautiful and engaging <a href="http://www.jasonbruges.com/projects/international-projects/mimosa">Mimosa </a>. It is an exhibit that you can interact with, and had character (mainly due to one of the "flowers" having a twitch that made it seem eager to be interacted with). Very satisfying and playful. A thoroughly enjoyable visit, and a lovely space as well.</p></div>
