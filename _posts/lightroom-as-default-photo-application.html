My copy of Lightroom arrived today, so I've installed it and its all happy and lovely except I couldn't work out how to get it to be the default image application when I plug either the camera or a card reader in.  As usual with all things Mac, Richard came to the rescue and found a clue in the iPhoto help.  So, I simply opened <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/imagecapture/">Image Capture</a>, selected Preferences and set the "When a camera is connected open in" option to be Adobe Lightroom.  I've just plugged the camera in to check and its all working well.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-7313713705304760835?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
