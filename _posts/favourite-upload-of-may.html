    <p>In May I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/archives/date-posted/2010/05/calendar/">uploaded 176 photos</a></p><p>This photo was taken in Tokyo in January, and shows Richard standing in front of the map outside Shibuya station.</p><p>I love the colours of this photo, and I love the light.  In fact, the quality of the light was something I really noticed during the two days we spent in Tokyo.</p><p>This photo was taken on my Nikon d80 and processed using Lightroom.</p><p>I'm almost up to date with my photo processing, only having 75 unprocessed images left in my Lightroom queue.  So the chances are good that next months 'Upload of the month' will be more topical.</p></div>
