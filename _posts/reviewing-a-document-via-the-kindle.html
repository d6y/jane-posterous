<p>Another one for the "<a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/tag/nts">note to self</a>" file.</p>
<p><a href="http://richard.dallaway.com/">Richard</a> asked me to proof-read a review of a book he'd written. &nbsp;He sent it to me as a RTF document directly to my kindle via the free.kindle.com email address. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I found a few spelling mistakes, some grammar issues and some bits which didn't scan/parse as well as they could. &nbsp;I initially started making notes against them, but realised that without context these were useless, so started highlighting the relevant text too. &nbsp;Highlights and Notes are stored in date order, with the most recent at the end of a file, which means that to get this right, the order needs to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Highlight the text to give the comment context</li>
<li>Make a note about the thing that is spelt wrong or whatever</li>
</ul>
<p>As I hadn't done this, I needed to edit the clippings afterwards in a text file which was time-consuming and painful, and the main reason why I've written this as a blog post.</p>
<p>The clippings for all books can be found on the&nbsp;My Clippings.txt in the documents folder on the Kindle (or at least they can when mounted on a mac). &nbsp;This is a text file which contains information like:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;">==========</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">&lt;File Name&gt; (&lt;author name&gt;)</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">- Highlight Loc. 14  | Added on Friday, December 31, 2010, 04:23 PM</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"> &lt;highlighted text&gt;</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"> ==========</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">&lt;File Name&gt; (&lt;author name&gt;)</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">&nbsp;- Note Loc. 14  | Added on Friday, December 31, 2010, 04:24 PM</span><p /> <span style="font-size: x-small;"> &lt;contents of note&gt;</span></p>
<p>I needed to go through this file after I'd read the review and match up the Highlight with the Note and re-order. &nbsp;Definitely something to avoid next time, or to find/write a macro/script to help with</p>
