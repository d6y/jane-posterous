In my previous post about <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/blog/2008/07/how-to-work-out-which-are-valid-full.html">How to work out which are valid full text languages on a SQL Server 2005 instance</a> I referred to <span class="code">sys.syslanguages</span> and <span class="code">sys.fulltext_languages</span> in my queries, but didn't really say much more about them, so here goes<br /><h2>sys.syslanguages</h2><br />In the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms190303.aspx">definition on MSDN</a> it states<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">"Contains one row for each language present in the instance of SQL Server 2005. Although U.S. English is not in syslanguages, it is always available to SQL Server."</blockquote><br />And one thing on the choice of U.S. English vs UK English.  The <a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/sql/learn-sql-server/sql-server-full-text-search-language-features/">SQL Server Full Text Search: Language Features</a> says <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">"In actual fact UK English does not refer to the Queen's English or the English used in the United Kingdom, but International English; the English that is used in all other English speaking countries other than US English."</blockquote><br />As an English person, living in England and speaking English I find this a somewhat grating use of the phrase UK English.  Bah!<br /> <h2>sys.fulltext_languages</h2><br />In the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms176076.aspx">definition on MSDN</a> it states  <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">"This catalog view contains one row per language available for full-text indexing/querying operations. Each row provides an unambiguous representation of the available full-text linguistic resources that are registered with Microsoft SQL Server. The name or lcid can be specified in the full-text queries and full-text index DDL."</blockquote><br />The list in this table, doesn't match those in sys.syslanguages.  These are purely the full-text-indexable languages.  As I mentioned in my <a>previous post</a> 6 languages can be added by following <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms345188.aspx">these instructions</a>.  The line <blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">"The name or lcid can be specified in the full-text queries and full-text index DDL."</blockquote> refers to the ability to issue the following SQL:<br /><span class="code">SELECT * <br />FROM LanguageData<br />WHERE CONTAINS(*, 'the', language 1045 )</span> <br />which indicates that the locale used for querying should be 1045, which equates to Polish.  I have some sample SQL to post in the next few days which demonstrates the difference between indexing and querying language choices.<br /><h2>In General</h2><br />I've been doing quite a bit of work with trying to understand how the SQL Server 2005 full text index works, and how the language choice impacts it.  My knowledge of full text indexing as a whole to this stage hasn't been great, so I've done quite a lot of background reading.  Amongst the best resources I've found are:<ul><li><a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/sql/learn-sql-server/sql-server-full-text-search-language-features/">SQL Server Full Text Search: Language Features</a></li><li><a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/sql/learn-sql-server/sql-server-full-text-search-language-features,-part-2/">SQL Server Full Text Search Language Features, Part 2</a></li></ul> both by <a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/author/hilary-cotter/">Hillary Cotter</a> which provide a really simple, but yet pretty comprehensive introduction to the various features of indexing and querying using the Full Text Index service.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-7978895338603430228?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
