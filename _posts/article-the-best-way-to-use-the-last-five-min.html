<p>Every day, before leaving the office, save a few minutes to think about what just happened. Look at your calendar and compare what actually happened &mdash; the meetings you attended, the work you got done, the conversations you had, the people with whom you interacted, even the breaks you took &mdash; with your plan for what you wanted to have happen. Then ask yourself three sets of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How did the day go? What success did I experience? What challenges did I endure?</li>
<li>What did I learn today? About myself? About others? What do I plan to do &mdash; differently or the same &mdash; tomorrow? </li>
<li>Who did I interact with? Anyone I need to update? Thank? Ask a question? Share feedback?</li>
</ul>
<p><br /> This last set of questions is invaluable in terms of maintaining and growing relationships. It takes just a few short minutes to shoot off an email &mdash; or three &mdash; to share your appreciation for a kindness someone extended, to ask someone a question, or to keep someone in the loop on a project.</p>

<p>I read this on Sunday, and it seemed like a good, quick and effective way to incorporate a regular personal review into my life.  On Monday I added a 5 minute task into my work calendar with the subject "Daily Review" and popped these questions in it.  I took my 5 minutes both yesterday and today whilst still at my desk, and noted down my successes, my challenges, my learnings, my interactions and the thanking I should do (which I followed up immediately with emails to the relevant people (or their managers)).  It seemed like a great way to close my day.</p>
<p>What I'm unsure about though, is where to record my answers.  Is there ongoing value to my successes, my challenges, my learnings.  Should I be reviewing them in order to monitor my progress through the year?  Or are they mainly throw away observations with the learnings building up day by day?</p>
<p>Do any of you do anything like this? And if you do, do you record them for review/posterity? Do you use this as a diary/journal activity hand-writing the answers? Or jot them into a calendar item? Or not even note them down at all, using it just as a mental exercise?</p>
