    <p>This morning I took the dog out for a walk and was struck by the quality of the light.  Golden light shone off all the buildings, and everything looked clean.  </p><p>This photo was taken at around 7:20am (the EXIF says 1pm or so but that is when it was uploaded via the iPhone flickr app), a time when even just a week ago the sun wouldn't have risen.  In fact, the sun apparently only rose at 7:13am today, so this truly was the golden hour.  </p><p>It was a beautiful time to be out and about on the Brighton seafront and the recently restored bandstand stood out against the still blue sea and the blue sky looking magnificent.</p></div>
