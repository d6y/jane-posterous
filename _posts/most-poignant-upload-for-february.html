    <p>In February I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/archives/date-posted/2011/02/calendar/">uploaded 26 photos to flickr</a>.</p><p>This, like <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/favourite-upload-of-january-0">last months photo</a>, was taken for my <a href=" &lt;a href=">365 project</a>.  It was taken as we were leaving the hospital after my Dad had died.  It is chosen as my photo of the month as it represents loss, and that is what the second half of February has been about for me. </p><p>If this glove hadn't been there, at the bottom of those stairs on that day, then my 365 project would have finished the day before. As it is, I only managed <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/5445616223/in/dateposted/">one more day</a> before abandoning it.</p></div>
