After changing my laptop to a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/macbook.html">MacBook</a> I decided to make use of a recent train trip to redesign <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/Welcome.html">jane.dallaway.com</a>.  I've used <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/iweb/">iWeb</a> to put the basic design together, and then spent quite a few hours trying to work out what it had done with all the div tags.  I think I'm somewhere pretty close now, but apologies for any broken links or old-style pages.  With great apologies to the <a href="http://www.clearleft.com/">Brighton CSS gurus</a> who would probably look at the html and css and shudder.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-115144311289656211?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
