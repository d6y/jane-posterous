<p>In July I had a quiet month and only <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/archives/date-posted/2010/07/">uploaded 57 photos</a>.  Part of the reason for this is because the majority of my day to day iPhone photos are going to my <a href="http://janeonthemove.posterous.com/">janeonthemove</a> photoblog instead.  Only those photos which are potential contributions to one of my ongoing <a href="http://janeonthemove.posterous.com/pages/projects-57">projects</a> are making it on to flickr.</p>
<p>This photograph was taken on my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157623343192529/with/4845376065/">Superheadz Blue Ribbon</a>, their take on the Vivitar Ultra Wide camera, using, what is rapidly becoming my favourite film stock, Kodak Ektar 100.  This was only the 2nd film I'd shot on this camera, and I love it.  It's very small, light and extremely plasticy, but combined with the Ektar produces some wonderful coloured shots.  I will do a <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/tag/kitbag">review</a> of it when I've run a few more films through it.</p>
<p>Skitters, our dog, is often a fast moving animal, and I love the perspective of this, and the fact that only the middle of her seems to be still.  She's just doing what she does, running&nbsp;around all over the place.</p>
