<p><a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/weaving-project-8-flower-posey-flower-square">Last time I blogged about granny squares</a> I'd <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/6679453015/in/set-72157628824965039">made 5 of them</a>. I've now made 15 in total. I've found them to be very easy things to make whilst watching the tv, or whilst <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/6701818291/in/set-72157628824965039">on a train</a> last weekend.</p>
<p>The first set I made, were made with some lovely <a href="http://www.knitrowan.com/yarns/belle-organic-dk">Amy Butler by Rowan DK</a>&nbsp;yarn that I'd found at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.candh.co.uk/">C&amp;H Fabrics</a> in their sale. Although this was in the sale, it wasn't cheap enough that making lots and lots of granny squares wasn't going to hurt eventually. So, I followed a friend's advice and headed over to the <a href="http://www.kempswoolshop.com/">Kemps Wool Shop</a> site. I know very little about yarns yet, so experimenting with different materials and textures is part of the learning process - especially for the weaving side of things where splitty yarn makes consistency of weft almost impossible to achive.&nbsp;I decided that as the first batch were done using DK, the rest should be too, so I basically searched for any yarns under &pound;2 that were DK, and that no 2 brand/style combinations could be the same. &nbsp;This resulted in me ordering 10 balls of yarn (a mixture of 50g and 100g) which turned up on Friday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've now used all but two of them, and my experience has ranged from hate (<a href="http://www.sirdar.co.uk/yarns/classics/dk/Bonus_DK_F013">Sirdar Bonus DK</a> in sunflower yellow - used for squares <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/6720409561/in/set-72157628824965039">11</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/6720411787/in/set-72157628824965039">12</a>) to love (<a href="http://www.sirdar.co.uk/yarns/babyYarns/dkBaby/Snuggly_Baby_Bamboo_DK_F071">Sirdar Snuggly Baby Bamboo</a>&nbsp;in Paintbox pink&nbsp;- used in square <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/6720413695/in/set-72157628824965039">13</a>&nbsp;- which I found a joy to work with) with a lot of the others being somewhere in between. I still really like the Amy Butler by Rowan ones too, but they're a pretty expensive way to produce Granny Squares. I may give some of them a try out on the picture-frame loom as well to see how they perform in a weaving context.</p>
<p>My plan is to make a blanket out of these squares, it'll be an oddly sized blanket as I have a specific use for it in mind, but it'll be a blanket none the less. I've spotted patterns for quite a lot of variations on the granny square theme, so I'll be trying some of them out as I progress in my learnings.</p>
<p>Just to finish, here's a photo of my favourite one to date.</p>
