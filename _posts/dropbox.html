<p>I've been using <a href="http://www.getdropbox.com">Dropbox</a> for a good few months now, and have it installed at work and at home as a way to transfer files between the 2 without resorting to a USB stick.  I've also been using it to store non-sensitive odds and ends, like <a href="http://www.getdropbox.com/gallery/236211/1/Me?h=4c5270">photos of me that I might use as profile pictures</a>, or eBooks etc.  Until last week I hadn't really used it as a backup device.  <p />Last week I was due to give a <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/tag/madgex">Madgex</a> <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/tag/ilp">ILP</a> talk on Introduction to Digital Photography and realised that when I'd swapped my laptop for a desktop, the slidedeck was one thing I hadn't copied over.  I headed off in search of my old laptop and discovered it was still unformatted, but I'd been a bit too thorough and had deleted all the files.  I checked the file share in the office, but I hadn't put the slides there either.  By this point I'd cancelled the talk, and was preparing to rewrite it.  Then I thought about dropbox.  I remembered that I'd put the file onto Dropbox to transfer it home and back again, but could only find the background material - photos, mindmap etc.  I investigated Dropbox a bit further, and realised that Dropbox <a href="https://www.getdropbox.com/help/11">saves all previous versions of a file</a> and so all I needed to do was to click the "Show deleted files" link, find my slidedeck and restore it.  Job done, I breathed a <a href="http://twitter.com/JaneFoth/status/1383020900">deep sigh of relief</a> and was able to reschedule the presentation.<p />If you want to get a dropbox account, and fancy getting an extra 250MB on top of your standard free 2GB, then <a href="https://www.getdropbox.com/referrals/NTIzNjIxMTk">follow my referral</a>, create an account, install the software and voila.  We're both 250MB better off.</p>
