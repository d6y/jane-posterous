<br />I've just created my first <a href="http://www.flickr.com/galleries/">Flickr gallery</a>.  I've chosen the West Pier as my subject because, as I say in the gallery introduction <br /><blockquote>Whenever I get a new camera, or a new lens, I almost always end up taking photos of the West Pier [<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/3468943046/">1</a>][<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/3582563744/">2</a>].  Since moving to Brighton in 2001 I have watched the slow decline of the pier, and taken my own <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/tags/westpier/">fair share of photographs</a>.</blockquote><br />Some of these images make me smile, some of them make me sad, but they all have an emotional connection for me.  Hope you like them!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-3077034849943198693?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
