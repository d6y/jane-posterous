<p>Almost 4 years since I attended my <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/skill-swap-php">last (and first) SkillSwap</a> I had the good fortune to grab a space at last night's <a href="http://www.skillswap-brighton.org/skillswap/show/2+-+Introduction+to+Rails+by+Dominic+Mitchell">Introduction to Rails</a> presented by <a href="http://happygiraffe.net/blog/">Dominic Mitchell</a>.  This was held at <a href="http://www.lighthouse.org.uk/">Lighthouse</a> in one of the studios and was a really great venue - although we did have to fight our way through the <a href="http://www.dayofthefigurines.co.uk/">Day of the Figurines</a> launch party to get downstairs.<p /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<p />The evening started off with a 30 to 40 minute talk on Rails and Ruby, what is good, what is less good, what it does best and of course the history.  We then had some hands-on practical tasks, and so we split into groups and worked in groups of 2 or 3 to follow Dom's easy-to-follow instruction sheets.<p />Stage One: Creation of a model<br />Stage Two: Creation of a database table<br />Stage Three: Get rails to create the database <br />Stage Four: Create the scaffold to get the "quick and dirty" interface working<p />This followed on really well for me from the excellent <a href="http://www.webdd.org.uk/ViewSession.aspx?SessionID=59">Ruby on Rails for .Net developers</a> I attended at <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/webdd-overview">WebDD</a> as it covered a similar introduction, but with play time too.<p />All in all an excellent evening, and again leaving me with the intention to devote some playtime to Ruby and Rails.  It would be great to be able to have a follow up event to this one (or I guess I could keep an eye out for <a href="http://brighton-ruby.org/">Brighton Ruby</a> meetings), as I know that Dom didn't get through all of his slides and examples - I'd love to know what else he had in store for us...</p>
