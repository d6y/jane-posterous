Last week, thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/petapixel/status/5280546722">a petapixel tweet</a>, I stumbled across the Denver Post's article on <a href="http://blogs.denverpost.com/captured/2009/10/21/color-photography-from-russian-in-the-early-1900s/">Color Photography from Russia in the Early 1900â€™s</a> which includes some amazing colour photographs from an era when such things were rare.  I was interested in the almost 3D effect on some of them, especially the first one in the article (View of the monastery from Svetlitsa Island) and after a little bit of googling I found <a href="http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/empire/making.html">an article explaining how the images were made</a>.<p />Definitely worth a look at the photos and a read of the making of article too<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-4960058012470701341?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
