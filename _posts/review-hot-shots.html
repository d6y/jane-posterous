<p>I first met <a href="http://lomokev.com/">Kevin Meredith</a>, or <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lomokev/">lomokev</a> as he's more regularly referred to as, at a <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/hey-get-that-camera-out-of-here">BHCC event held in Brighton during the Brighton Photo Festival</a>.  He was part of a panel speaking on photography laws etc.  He sat amongst a panel of professional photographers (oh, and a lawyer) and introduced himself using a, in his words, cheap film camera to illustrate one of his points.  Shortly afterwards his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/2888930277/ref=s9_simz_gw_s11_p14_i1?pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=1Y8TS4S3T80CMNKR7GSN&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=467128533&amp;pf_rd_i=468294">Hot Shots</a>, came out and after hearing good things about it in the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/brighton/">Brighton Flickr community</a>, I picked up a copy.  <p />Hot Shots is a simple book, and it is a general book - touching on many different themes and subjects and introducing them in a clear, and beautifully illustrated (it contains many photos from lomokev's flickr stream) way.  I read the book, twice, in a couple of days, and found it to be really accessible, interesting and inspirational.  I wanted to head out and take photos.  But more than that, I wanted to head out with a film camera and take photos.  Lomokev doesn't preach about which camera to use or anything, but I was so impressed by the examples of photos that I wanted to try film again myself.<p />Despite having had a camera of one sort or another since I was at least 10, possibly earlier, it wasn't until I got a prosumer digital camera (Canon G3) that I started to learn about aperture, shutter speeds, exposure etc.  I found the use of EXIF data, coupled with the immediate feedback, a great way to learn.  But, having learnt this way, and being comfortable with most of the basic aspects of photography, I was interested to see what difference returning to film would mean.  I've got Mum's <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/kit-bag-balda-baldixette">Balda Baldixette</a> out of the cupboard, bought a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/tags/pentaxpc33/">Pentax P33</a> (&pound;3 from eBay for taking out in my dog-walking bag) and gained a beautiful orange <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/tags/blackbirdfly/">Blackbird, Fly</a> and have been filling them up with my current favourite film, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/tags/kodakporta400vc/">Kodak Portra VC400</a>.  It's been interesting and is a very different thought process - with the DSLR it is more of a take photo, review, take another one, review again, take the final one.  With the film cameras it is much more of a think up front process.  And there is still the delight and excitement of picking up the processed film from Colourstream.<p />Hot Shots is a great book, full of tips and concepts, illustrated with beautiful imagery, and explained in a very simple way.  Go grab a copy.</p>
