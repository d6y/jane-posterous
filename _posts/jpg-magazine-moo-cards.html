When reading one of <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/1262/">Jeremy's posts</a> the other day, I stumbled across his link to <a href="http://www.jpgmag.com/about/">JPG Magazine</a>.  JPG Magazine describes itself as <i>JPG Magazine is for people who love imagemaking without attitude. It's about the kind of photography you get when you love the moment more than the camera. It's for photographers who, like us, have found themselves online, sharing their work, and would like to see that work in print.</i>  Seems like a nice idea, so I've just spent the last half an hour reading through stories, and viewing photographs.  I like the fact that there is hard copy available too, although admittedly it looks pretty hard to get at in the UK.<p />He also linked to <a href="http://www.moo.com/">Moo</a>, whom I had spotted through the flickr link.  <i>MOO dreams up new tools that help people turn their virtual content into beautiful print products.</i>  It looks like there is some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/mooswap/pool/">Moo card swapping</a> going on.  I'm yet to see any Moo cards in the wild, but they do look cute...<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-8255207898445345799?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
