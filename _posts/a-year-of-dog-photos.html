    <p>Today is the first anniversary of being a dog owner, and during that one year of dog ownership, I've <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/tags/skitters">uploaded 314 photos of Skitters to flickr</a>.  This is the one that flickr tells me is most interesting of them all.  It was taken on my <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/kit-bag-blackbird-fly">Blackbird, Fly</a> using a roll of the lovely <a href="http://www.kodak.com/global/en/professional/products/films/ektar/ektarIndex.jhtml">Kodak Ektar 100</a> negative film at low tide on Lancing beach.</p></div>
