<h3>10 ways to eliminate distractions</h3>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Turn off your email, IM and Twitter and phone notifications<br /> <strong>2.</strong> Turn off the Internet. Pull the plug!<br /> <strong>3.</strong> (If you need the internet to work) find a way to block out distractions<br /> <strong>4.</strong> Headphones – music is a great way to fall into your own little (focussed) world<br /> <strong>5.</strong> Create a <strong>DO NOT DISTURB</strong> sign… co-workers will soon get the hint<br /> <strong>6.</strong> Clear workspace clutter – create your own Zen Desk, free of ’stuff’<br /> <strong>7.</strong> Clear computer clutter – create your own Zen Desktop, free of distracting icons <br /> <strong>8.</strong> Handle interruptions – find ways to quickly get back to the task at hand<br /> <strong>9.</strong> Use minimal programs (without all the distracting bells-and-whistles)<br /> <strong>10.</strong> Distraction time – allow yourself 10 minutes to unwind once every hour!</p>

<p>Well worth reading <a href="http://freelanceswitch.com/productivity/10-ways-to-eliminate-distractions/#">the original article</a> too.  I fall foul of quite a few of these, and need to get much better at switching off the shiny internet thing.  One problem is that my todo list is on <a href="http://www.toodledo.com/">toodledo</a>, and hence I use the internet for that and it is a small step to open up a new tab and procrastinate.</p>
<p>Last week I reworked my task list process, and started estimating how long items would take to do and then (roughly) tracking them.  I started planning my todo list based on the time that I had in my calendar which wasn't booked out for meetings.  It was quite enlightening.  I try and work from home on Wednesday afternoons and so schedule a lot of my management and strategy tasks for then.  When I opened toodledo on Wednesday, I discovered that I had 12 hours of tasks planned.  No wonder I felt like I wasn't achieving much, I've been over-allocating myself (at times).  During last week, as an experiment, I also added tasks in that I'd done which were added during the day so that I can see if these are truly urgent tasks that couldn't have waited until the next day.</p>
<p>On my recent appraisal, under the "What have I learnt?" section I wrote "My <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/tag/timemanagement">time management process</a> gets refined in an ongoing manner".  This is just another example of that.</p>
