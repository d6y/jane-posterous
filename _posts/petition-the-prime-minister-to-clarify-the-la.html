<a href="http://www.beautyandruin.com/monkeys/">Alex</a> sent me the link to an article from the BBC news last week on <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7351252.stm">Innocent photographer or terrorist?</a> about the treatment of a photographer by the police.  It is something I've often been concerned about myself, but fortunately have only ever had run-ins with the security guards in shopping centres.<p />So when I spotted a <a href="http://www.londonphotos.org/archives/photographers_rights.html">blog post</a> over at <a href="http://www.londonphotos.org/">London Photos</a> mentioning a petition to <a href="http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/photographylaw/">clarify the laws surrounding photography in public places</a> I thought I'd add my name to the list.  Currently 3,483 other people have done so too, so if you're a UK citizen and interested in getting the laws clarified, then <a href="http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/photographylaw/">head on over and add yourself</a>.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-6596960387048020880?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
