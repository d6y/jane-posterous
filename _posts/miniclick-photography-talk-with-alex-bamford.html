<p>Last night I had the pleasure of attending the first <a href="http://blog.clickclickjim.com/2010/08/18/miniclick1/">MiniClick photography talk</a> at <a href="http://www.addcolour.co.uk/">Add the Colour</a>&nbsp;in Brighton to hear <a href="http://www.alexbamford.com/">Alex Bamford</a> &nbsp;talk us through some of his Moonlighting images.<div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<p>After a train-related delay, Alex talked us through the history of his moonlight photographs, from the inception (whilst running an advertising shoot in Japan with an established low-light photographer), through the learning process, to the obsession with <a href="http://www.alexbamford.com/moonmills">windmills</a>, and on to his more recent and potential new obsession <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bambooly/4926275366/in/set-72157600168640332/">posts in the sea</a>, and featuring on the journey, of course, the light sticks and light balls which are a familiar sight in his photographs.</p>
<p>Here are some of Alex's photos (via <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bambooly/">his flickr account</a>):</p>

<p>It was an enjoyable few hours, spent amongst others with an interest in photography.  The cafe is a great, light and airy place, with a good selection of hot and cold drinks, snacks and the like, and as an event it does pretty well on my <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/response-to-where-the-tech-ladies-at">list of things which will make me more comfortable</a>. &nbsp;The next event is on the 5th October and features <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amooseabroad">Kris Mitchell</a>, and I'd recommend getting yourself along there - I certainly plan to make these a regular event in my diary.</p>
