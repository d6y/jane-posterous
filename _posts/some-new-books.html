<p>I headed over to the <a href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/retailing/article6936248.ece">Borders closing down</a> sale the other day and picked up a few more photography books (as if <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography-bookshelf">my shelf</a> wasn't already creaking!).  The new additions were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hot-Shoe-Diaries-Creative-Applications/dp/0321580141/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1260991208&amp;sr=1-1">The Hot Shoe Diaries: Big light from small flashes by Joe McNally</a> - bought to learn more about flash lighting and off-camera flash after attending <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/flash-improve-your-lighting-techniques">my recent course</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Digital-Photography-Book-v/dp/0321617657/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1260991230&amp;sr=1-1">The Digital Photography Book Volume 3 by Scott Kelby</a> - I already have volumes 1 and 2, so seemed foolish not to complete the set</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Penguin-Icons-Christine-Eckstrom/dp/3836508818/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1260991164&amp;sr=8-3">Penguin by Frans Lanting</a> - I love penguins, a photo book of penguins for under &pound;3 seemed like something I shouldn't miss</li>
</ul>
<p><br />So, yet more books to read... I love books, but I never seem to get the opportunity to study them as much as I'd like.  Maybe another thing for the 2010 to do list?</p>
