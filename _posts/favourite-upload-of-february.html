    <p>In February I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/archives/date-posted/2010/02/">uploaded 247 photos</a>.</p><p>This photo was taken at Paddington Reservoir, Paddington, Sydney.  It was taken on my Nikon d80, and processed using Lightroom where I converted it to black and white. </p><p>The reason I've chosen this as my favourite photo of the month is because I love the sense of depth.  The pattern of the fence in the foreground crosses with the pattern of the steps in the background.  The graffiti on the wall gives another set of patterns.</p><p>Jono took us to Paddington, originally because we wanted to go to the <a href="http://www.blender.com.au/">Blender gallery</a>.  On this day the gallery was shut as it was still the Christmas period - we did later go and visit.  Instead we strolled around Paddington, and I found the old <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/tags/paddingtonreservoir/">reservoir to be an excellent location for photography</a>.  Well recommended if you have some spare time, and your camera.</p></div>
