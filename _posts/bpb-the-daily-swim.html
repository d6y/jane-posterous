<p>The <a href="http://www.bpb.org.uk/">Brighton Photo Biennial</a> kicked off today, a festival which is going to keep me busy for quite a bit of October. &nbsp;As we were heading off to <a href="http://www.brightonbreeze.co.uk/">Brighton Breeze</a> to look at the pretty VW vans, we stopped by <a href="http://lomokev.com/">Lomokev</a>'s <a href="http://www.photofringe.org/">fringe exhibition</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.photofringe.org/?p=270">The Daily Swim</a>&nbsp;at the <a href="http://www.brightonsc.co.uk/Sea%20Swimming.htm">Sea Swimming Club</a> on the seafront. &nbsp;The photographs will be displayed there again tomorrow, before moving to the lovely and tasty <a href="http://www.iydea.co.uk/">Iydea</a> cafe next week and are definitely worth a look, if possible, down at the sea swimming club. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I think these are the first of Kevin's photos that I've seen printed which aren't in one of his books, and they reproduce beautifully and show the colours and quality that I've come to expect from watching <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lomokev/">his flickr stream</a>.</p>
