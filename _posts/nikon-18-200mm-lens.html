I'm still waiting for my <a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/template.php?cat=1&amp;grp=5&amp;productNr=2159">18-200mm Nikon lens</a> - there really seems to be a shortage of these lenses in the UK at the moment.  <a href="http://jessops.com/">Jessops</a> apparently have a 200+ on order, and of those 80 are already ordered for customers.<p />So, I'm still using my <a href="http://www.sigmaphoto.com/lenses/lenses_all_details.asp?id=3300&amp;navigator=6">Sigma 30mm</a> lens for all photos, and the more I use it, the more I love it.  Hope I love the Nikon one too when it finally appears.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-8340570076909101902?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
