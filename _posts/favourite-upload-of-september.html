<p>In September <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/archives/date-posted/2009/09/">I uploaded 36 public photos to flickr</a>.<p />This photo is of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiteford_Sands">Whiteford Sands</a> on the Gower Peninsular in Wales.  <p />We walked through a Nature Reserve to get to the sand dunes - so lovely big trees in amongst the sands - and then popped out onto a beach to see this. The Whiteford Lighthouse can just be seen in the background. Beautiful, beautiful place - and we had it pretty much to ourselves.<p />It was taken with my Mum's old <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/kit-bag-balda-baldixette">Balda Baldixette</a> using <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/tags/kodakporta400vc/">Kodak Portra 400VC</a><p />As with the rest of my photos taken using <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/tags/film">film</a>, the photo has had no post processing and was developed and scanned by <a href="http://www.colourstream.net/">Colourstream</a> in Brighton.</p>
