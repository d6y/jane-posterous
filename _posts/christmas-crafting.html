<p>Whilst visiting Richard's folks in Margate, I had some time to craft a few things (in order of them starting):</p>
<p><strong>Weaving Project #6 - a sampler</strong></p>
<p>I decided to put the maximum number of warp threads I could onto my picture frame loom (33 as it turns out) and just try out a few things. I started off doing sets of 6 weft rows in pink, interlaced with 2 weft rows in blue.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/6601277217/" title="Project #6 in progress by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7161/6601277217_a77504bfda.jpg" height="500" alt="Project #6 in progress" width="335" /></a></p>
<p>The bottom section is just plain weave. Then second section is over 2 and under 1. The third section is a plain weave with a diamond. The fourth section is the inverse of the second section - under 2 over 1. The fifth section is over 2 and under 2.</p>

<p>For the main, middle section, I attempted to follow my first proper draft, and as it was an 8 warp pattern, I used plain weave on the edges, and left a warp thread visible to use as a frame. The draft I followed was <a href="http://www.handweaving.net/PatternDisplay.aspx?PATTERNID=45398">this one</a> from the fantastic <a href="http://www.handweaving.net/">Handweaving.net</a></p>
<p>Then I repeated the first 5 sections in reverse before finishing off both ends using hemstitching.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/6601287681/" title="Project #6 finished by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7175/6601287681_4798aae157.jpg" height="500" alt="Project #6 finished" width="334" /></a></p>
<p>I learnt a few things during this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not all yarns are created even - the pink yarn (as with the blues in <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/weaving-project-5">project #5</a>) split very easily and make it really difficult to get any form of consistency</li>
<li>It is important to leave a good amount of overlap when joining weft threads together - there is a bit of a gap at the back</li>
<li>Drafts aren't too hard to follow - although I did have to transcribe it onto paper to be able to follow it properly and scribble notes as I went</li>
<li>For neatness/consistency, it would make more sense for me to start hemstitching at the bottom right, and start at the top left - that way I'm doing the same stitches</li>
<li>I need think about tension consistency all of the time (although it isn't as bad in real life as this picture makes it look)</li>
<li>Making things for the sake of making them isn't very satisfying - I need to find projects to use my creations</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Flower loom flower bookmark</strong></p>
<p>A friend bought me a <a href="http://departmentofsmallworks.co.uk/shop/conversations-on-the-coast.aspx">lovely book</a> for Christmas, and despite having made 2 bookmarks as presents (<a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/weaving-project-3">#3</a>, <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/weaving-project-5">#5</a>) for other people, I didn't have one myself. As the loom was still being used for Weaving Project #6, I decided to knock up a bookmark using the flower loom and a simple chain stitched "stalk"</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/6601280131/" title="Flower loom bookmark by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7007/6601280131_1bc44b7f81.jpg" height="500" alt="Flower loom bookmark" width="335" /></a></p>
<p>It is a simple creation - just 4 rounds of duck egg blue on the smaller of the pins on my <a href="http://www.thelittlelostsheep.co.uk/bloom-loom.html">bloom loom</a>&nbsp;with a long tail left at the beginning, and at the end, and the centre stitched in the darker blue. &nbsp;The two tails were then just chained together (I can't crochet yet, so although messy, this is a major achievement)</p>

<p><strong>Flower loom flowers</strong></p>
<p>Flower loom flowers are quite addictive. They're very simple, and don't take much time to make - 20 - 30 minutes each depending on the complexity. And yet they look quite good. These are going to make a posey for my Mum. A friend has sent me lots of other ideas for things I can do with these flowers too, so there will be more of these being created. There was an additional one created, but it was gifted to my Mother-In-Law.</p>

<p><strong>Weaving Project #7 - a bookmark</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/6601290037/" title="Project #7 ready for de-looming by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7167/6601290037_5cdea59f39.jpg" height="500" alt="Project #7 ready for de-looming" width="334" /></a></p>
<p>This project was properly planned from start to finish - I looked through HandWeaving.net to select <a href="http://handweaving.net/PatternDisplay.aspx?PATTERNID=51191">a draft that didn't look too complicated</a>, and then worked out the number of warps I'd need (a multiple of 3 plus 2 on either side as a "margin"). The yellow thread is the same style of thread as that used in Project #6 but it works fine as a warp and doesn't split in the same way. I used some green wool I picked up a while ago as the weft and found it much easier, and more consistent to work with resulting in pretty straight edges. I now need to work out how to determine whether a yarn will work or not without standing in a shop and twisting it around.</p>
<p>This is the first weaving project since <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/weaving-project-3">#3</a> that I can say I'm actually happy with. The yarn worked well, the pattern was easy to follow, and I enjoyed making it. Even the fringe bits are much more even than my previous attempts (don't ever let me cut your hair though - chances are that you'll end up with much less hair than you planned)</p>

<p>I like the reverse just as much.</p>

<p>The only problem I have is that I mainly use my kindle for reading, so don't actually need a lot of bookmarks. However, more bookmarks will be being created as they're a great size to experiment with, and only take about 3 hours to weave.</p>
<p>I'm hoping to find some time over the rest of the holiday period to craft a few more bits and bobs, but thought that this was a big enough blog post already!</p>
