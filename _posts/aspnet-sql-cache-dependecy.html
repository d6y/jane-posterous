I stumbled across some of the <a href="http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/SearchResults.aspx?culture=en-US&amp;evtTyp=4&amp;evtTypHero=4">Microsoft Virtual Labs</a> the other day and thought I'd give the ASP.NET ones a try.  My theory was that whilst they were pretty basic, there may well be areas that I just didn't know about.  I've just been doing the <a href="http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/WebCastEventDetails.aspx?EventID=1032297850&amp;EventCategory=3&amp;culture=en-US&amp;CountryCode=US">ASP.NET 2.0 Data Access Virtual Lab</a> and discovered the <a href="http://www.ondotnet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2005/01/17/sqlcachedependency.html">SQL Cache dependency</a>.  In recent projects we have always separated our data layer out completely, and made use of the <a href="http://www.codersource.net/microsoft_data_access_application_block_azam.html">Microsoft.ApplicationBlock.Data</a> code to control our data access and so haven't needed to know about the <a href="http://www.codeguru.com/csharp/.net/net_asp/miscellaneous/article.php/c8517/">EnableCaching</a> property and its impact.  So, the moral of this story is that they're worth persisting with even though they can be quite slow some times.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-7259241102884368637?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
