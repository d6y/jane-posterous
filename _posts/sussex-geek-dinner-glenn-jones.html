<p>Last night, <a href="http://www.glennjones.net/home/">Glenn Jones</a> spoke about <a href="http://microformats.org/">Microformats</a> at the latest <a href="http://sussex.geekdinner.co.uk/?p=16">Sussex Geek Dinner</a>.  This was a talk I'd been interested in hearing at the <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/webdd-overview">WebDD event</a> in February, but failed due to the popularity of the session.  It was really interesting, and inspiring, and has added another lot of "to do"s for <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com">this site</a>, the <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/">jane and richard</a> site and <a href="http://www.brightonbloggers.com/">brighton bloggers</a> to make the most of microformats. I'm just heading off to install the firefox addin <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4106">Operator</a> now to see what pages have got microformats embedded into them.<p />I spent quite a bit of the rest of the evening getting opinions on my <a href="http://www.brightonbloggers.com/blog/archives/2007_03_01_index.php#5998287008829769766">request for comments</a> on Brighton Bloggers the other day.  <a href="http://www.eventyr.co.uk/ramblings.html">Joh</a>, <a href="http://yandleblog.blogspot.com/">Danny</a> and <a href="http://www.rosiesherry.com/blog/">Rosie</a> had some great feedback and I look forward to following up with one of Joh's ideas shortly.</p>
