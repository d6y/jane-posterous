A <a href="http://www.bjp-online.com/">British Journal of Photography</a> <a href="http://www.bjp-online.com/public/showPage.html?page=801977 ">article</a> states that:<p /><blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Local restrictions on photography in public places are legitimate the Home Secretary has stated in a letter to the National Union of Journalists.</blockquote><p />It continues to say that there are no legal restrictions, but that local Chief Constables were allowed to restrict or monitor photographers in 'reasonable" circumstances.  It also quotes from a letter sent from the home secretary that :<p /><blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">The home office does not provide any guidance on photography in public places</blockquote><p />To my mind this is far, far worse than having documented legal restrictions.  This means that every time I take my camera out to any public place I am at the mercy of these unpublished "local restrictions" and the level of force that these "local restrictions" are governed by.  <p />(Spotted via <a href="http://andypiper.wordpress.com/">Andy</a>'s <a href="http://twitter.com/andypiper/statuses/853468425">tweet</a>)<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-5492521977599137124?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
