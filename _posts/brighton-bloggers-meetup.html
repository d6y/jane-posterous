<p>As mentioned <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/screenshots-from-web-pages">the other day</a> I put together a collage of blog screen shots for 279 of the sites listed at <a href="http://www.brightonbloggers.com/blogs/">Brighton Bloggers</a>.  If you look really closely, there are some which are just directory listings, even a couple of blank pages.  Anyway, this was produced on A3 and A2 paper thanks to Kirsty and James at <a href="http://www.brightenupme.com/">Brightenup</a> and taken along to the <a href="http://www.brightonbloggers.com/blog/archives/2007_07_01_index.php#7664479695905664137">meetup</a>.  It was <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/749405339/">met with interest</a> although a magnifying glass might have helped :-)</p>
