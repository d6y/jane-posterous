Last week I upgraded <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/">my Flickr account</a> to be a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/upgrade/">pro</a> member.  I'm planning on making more use of flickr to put up images that I don't really know what else to do with - like the ones I link to from the blogs, or for photos of various events, like the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157594486314874/">Sussex Geek Dinner</a>, or <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157594497972300/">Brighton Bloggers meetups</a>.<p />I'm using the <a href="http://flickr.com/tools/mac_howto.gne">Flickr Uploader tool for the Mac</a> and finding that is working for me pretty well, but as usual recommendations of other tools are always welcome.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-7383831775256354810?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
