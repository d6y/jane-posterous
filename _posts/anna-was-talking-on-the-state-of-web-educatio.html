<p>Yesterday <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/denisewilton/status/5658600345178112">Denise tweeted</a> a <a href="http://maban.co.uk/630#">link to the video</a> of <a href="http://maban.co.uk/">Anna Debenham</a>'s talk on the state of web education to the <a href="http://www.londonwebstandards.org/">London Web Standards</a> Group. &nbsp;Denise also popped some <a href="http://styledeficit.tumblr.com/post/1619250168/the-case-for-revolutionizing-how-we-teach-web-design">comments on it on her tumblr feed</a>.</p>
<p>I stored it away in my "to watch" list, and got an opportunity earlier to take a look.</p>
<p>My reaction, firstly, you can make websites using powerpoint? really? I had no idea. &nbsp;I knew you could use Word to do it - I stumble across them frequently in my day job at the moment (due to legitimately scraping <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shonky">shonky</a> sites) and swear loudly every time at the poorly formatted html, littered with mso atttributes. &nbsp;But why oh why are we teaching children to do this. &nbsp;Whilst watching <a href="http://maban.co.uk/630#">her presentation</a> I had quite a few sweary outbursts, so many that Richard came in to find out what the matter was. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Next weekend, I'm going to see my 14 year old nephew and will quiz him a little more intently on what he's currently doing in his ICT classes at the moment. &nbsp;I know in the past there has been an emphasis on using powerpoint to do presentations, but I haven't enquired recently what he has been up to. &nbsp;We tried to get him programming using python using the <a href="http://www.manning.com/sande/">Hello World!</a> book a few years ago, but once we weren't there to encourage him, his enthusiasm waned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anna has since spoken at <a href="http://www.drumbeat.org/">Mozilla Drumbeat</a> to (she says) mixed reactions, although everything I've read seems positive.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/anna_debenham/status/5925872922009600">She tweets</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Reading some nasty comments about my presentation. "na&iuml;ve", "20yr old thinks she knows everything". Expected but really, really hurts :(</blockquote>
<p>but I'm with Seb and Aral</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/aral/status/6020488069382144">Aral says</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">@<a href="http://twitter.com/anna_debenham" class="  twitter-atreply" rel="nofollow">anna_debenham</a> @<a href="http://twitter.com/boagworld" class="  twitter-atreply" rel="nofollow">boagworld</a> Just went through it here and it looks perfect, Anna. Let's set up an event in Brighton on this issue.</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/seb_ly/status/6023777259360256">Seb replied with</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">@<a href="http://twitter.com/aral" class="  twitter-atreply" rel="nofollow">aral</a> @<a href="http://twitter.com/anna_debenham" class="  twitter-atreply" rel="nofollow"><strong>anna_debenham</strong></a> @<a href="http://twitter.com/boagworld" class="  twitter-atreply" rel="nofollow">boagworld</a> Where do I sign up to be a part of that? <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23passionateabouteduction" class="  twitter-hashtag" title="#passionateabouteduction" rel="nofollow">#passionateabouteduction</a> :-)</blockquote>
<p>The following is the video of the talk that Anna presented at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.drumbeat.org/">Mozilla Drumbeat</a>&nbsp;(watch this one if you're short of time and want to get an idea of her message - its only 10 minutes long):</p>

<p>My other take away from this, beyond the shock of how out of date the curriculum is, is a reminder to make sure that any events I organise are accessible for the under 18s/under 21s as well as making participants feel comfortable (see <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/response-to-where-the-tech-ladies-at">my list from a few months ago</a>)</p>
