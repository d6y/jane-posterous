<a href="http://www.madgex.com">Madgex</a> and the <a href="http://www.traintogain.gov.uk/">Train to Gain</a> scheme run by <a href="http://ccb.ac.uk/">City College Brighton and Hove</a> are kindly helping me, and my fellow team leaders, to work towards our <a href="http://www.i-l-m.com/learn-with-ilm/1041.aspx">Level 3 NVQ in Management</a>.  I haven't studied for any qualification since 1993 when I graduated from university, so this whole learning thing is a bit overwhelming.  However, this is a vocational qualification rather than academic and so should be more relevant to what I actually do/should do (I hope!)<p />The information tells me that this is suitable for me if:<br /><blockquote>you are a practising first line manager who has:<ul><li>a tightly defined area of responsibility</li><li>some limited opportunity for taking decisions and managing budgets</li><li>responsibility for achieving specific results by using resources effectively</li><li>responsibility for allocating work to team members, colleagues and contractors</li></ul></blockquote>Well, I don't have any budgetary control, and I'm not sure my area of responsibility is tightly defined but the rest is a pretty good fit...<p />There are 7 units to complete - 4 are mandatory and the remaining 3 are taken from a choice of 11 based on relevance to the current role.  The mandatory ones are:<ul><li>Manage your own resources and professional development</li><li>Provide leadership in your area of responsibility</li><li>Allocate and monitor the progress and quality of work in your area of responsibility</li><li>Ensure health and safety requirements are met in your area of responsibility</li></ul><br />I met with my assessor yesterday and had a good overview of where we start and what I need to do.  I'll be meeting with her on a monthly basis, and will also have one of the Senior Managers from Madgex on hand to give advice and support.  My first homework for this month is to <ul><li>update my CV</li><li>dig out my job description</li><li>read the definitions of all the mandatory units</li><li>read the definitions for all the optional units and work out which I believe to be most relevant and discuss them with both my line manager and my Senior Manager mentor</li><li>complete the worksheet with questions relating to our industry</li></ul><br />Wish me luck!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-6365536495677186820?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
