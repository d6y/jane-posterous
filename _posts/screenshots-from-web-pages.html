As preparation for the <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/203241/">Brighton Bloggers meetup</a> on Thursday I wanted to put together a set of images reflecting the blogs that are represented.  Last time I printed out the list and had that.  I will do that again, but I thought a collage or slideshow would be fun.<p />I came up with some alternatives:<br /><ul><li>screencapture - native to Mac OS.  This works on the command line, but captures either the full screen, or a window.  I couldn't find a way to direct it at a browser window. (I found this via <a href="http://blog.webmages.com/2003/04/08/osx-screenshots-in-png/">osx screenshots (in png)</a>)</li><li><a href="http://www.derailer.org/paparazzi/">Paparazzi!</a> - I couldn't find a way to use this on the command line but then started wondering about <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/applescript/">applescript</a>.  Paparazzi is based on Webkit2png (see below) hence there are some similarities.  I found <a href="http://www.leftbrained.co.uk/archive/2006/04/27/a-pre-reboot-script">Galarrhea</a> which is an applescript that imports tags from del.icio.us, magnolia or a text file and produces full size and 200 x 200 cropped images using Paparazzi! (The 200 x 200 can be changed within the applescript).  It took me a while to find out where these images had been placed but I eventually found them in /user/jane/Sites/galarrhea.</li><li><a href="http://www.paulhammond.org/webkit2png/">Webkit2png</a> - a command line python script that accepts a url as a parameter and outputs 3 png files - clipped, thumb and full.  Webkit2png needs <a href="http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/software/">objective C</a> to work properly used <span class="code">sudo port install py-pyobjc</span> to download and install Objective C and Python 2.4</li></ul><br />I ended up using Webkit2png and generated 278 images based on the blogs listed on <a href="http://www.brightonbloggers.com/blogs">BrightonBloggers</a><p />The command line I used is <span class="code">/opt/local/bin/python /users/jane/webkit2png-0.4.txt.sh -D /users/jane/Desktop/Bloggers/ -o   -C --clipheight=250 --clipwidth==250</span> for each of the 278 blogs.<p />Now I just need to stick them together into a collage.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-2925771883074702976?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
