<p>I love hats, and during autumn/winter/this summer I can often be found with a hat on my head. My hairdresser has strict instructions that no matter how she cuts my hair, it must be in a style that tolerates having a hat stuck on it. When I was planning a trip to Yorkshire with a friend I decided that I needed a wet weather project (given the state of the weather during the previous few weeks), and started looking for patterns for a hat. My friend pointed me at <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/swirls-cap">this</a> and I decided to give it a go. It looked a bit complicated, but my friend is talented and said she'd help, so that was fine.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the weather was glorious and so the hat wasn't started, which meant I was on my own with it! A couple of weekends ago I was watching the Olympics and wanted a project to work on. I'd finished my previous crochet project and, as I've said before, <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/lessons-learnt-so-far-in-weaving">I can't weave and do anything else</a>, so I figured I'd start on the hat.</p>
<p>I was somewhat apprehensive as there were a lot of new things to learn for this project, but the internet was a great help. I sat down and learnt how to do front post double crochet (and love how it looks). I learnt how to do double crochet, and later single crochet, decreases.</p>
<p>The hat is made using <a href="http://www.knitrowan.com/yarns/pure-wool-dk">Rowan DK Pure Wool</a> in a lovely grey shade. I adapted the pattern in two places. Firstly I added an extra row of increases (and corresponding decrease) in the double crochet/front post double crochet main body of the hat as it wasn't measuring at 9" as per the instructions. Secondly, I added an additional row of the plain round as per the instructions "You can repeat this plain round if you want a deeper hat."</p>

<p>I found the brim to be the most challenging part of the hat, and ended up calculating exactly how many stitches should be in each row to ensure I got it right as it took me 3 or 4 attempts to get the lower brim correct. In the photo above you can see lots of pencil scribblings which was my calculations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only problem with the finished hat, is that it's a bit too tight. So, I have a couple of options, either I do something to try and <a href="http://knitting-crocheting.knoji.com/how-to-stretch-out-a-knit-hat/">stretch it</a>, or I find someone with a smaller head and gift them it. Suggestions welcomed.</p>

<p>Either way, I'm certainly going to make another one, but I'll probably use a slightly bigger hook (5mm instead of 4.5mm) to ensure I get a better fit. I'm also wondering if I could drop the brim altogether and use the sizings as it is, possibly without the extra plain round, to make a beanie. All in all, pretty pleased with the result, and aren't going to be quite so intimidated by complex patterns, I love the colour, and love the style, it's just a shame about the fit.</p>
