I've just posted my first question to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a> which relates to <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">bugzilla</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1486580/how-do-you-handle-related-bugs-in-bugzilla">how to relate bugs across projects together</a> and I figured I'd ask the question here as well.  So here goes:<br /><blockquote>Within our environment we have a core codebase, and several client-specific implementations of that codebase. When a client raises an issue, we need to determine whether it is a client specific issue, or whether it is a core codebase issue.<p />We use bugzilla to track our bugs, and we have a bugzilla product for the core codebase, and also for the client implementation (as they have customised the offering to have enhanced functionality). When a client raises a bug that relates to the core codebase, we need to raise that bug in 2 bugzilla products - core and client - so that both teams know about the issue. Ideally, we'd relate these bugs together so that we don't waste effort attempting to fix it twice, and so that the 2 Project Managers are fully informed of the progress of that issue.<p />My best idea so far is to use a comment/description including the works "Relates to bug " as it appears that the words bug magically become a link to the specified bug making it easy to get to that other bug's detail. This can then be searched for via the "A comment contains the search" criteria.<p />How do others do this?</blockquote><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-2892358175470251832?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
