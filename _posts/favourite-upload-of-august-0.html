    <p>In August I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/archives/date-posted/2010/08">uploaded 162 photos to flickr</a>.</p><p>This photograph is of Richard and Skitters standing on a fell in the Lake District, with the beautiful lake of Wastwater in the background.  A beautiful photograph (in my humble opinion) of a beautiful place.  Go and explore Wastwater yourself if you get a chance.</p><p>As with <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/favourite-upload-of-july-0">last months photo</a>, this photograph was taken on my Superheadz Blue Ribbon using Kodak Ektar 100.</p></div>
