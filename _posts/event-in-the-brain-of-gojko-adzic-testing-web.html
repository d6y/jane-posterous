<p>On Thursday evening I attended the <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/">Skills Matter</a> event <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/testing-web-applications-with-selenium-selenium-remote-control">In The Brain of Gojko Adzic: Testing Web Applications with Selenium &amp; Selenium Remote Control</a> which was a great follow up to <a href="http://kerrybuckley.org/">Kerry Buckley</a>'s Web Testing with Selenium talk he did at <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/barcamp-brighton-day-2">Barcamp Brighton last September</a>.<p /><a href="http://twitter.com/d6y">Richard</a> has been to a few <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/go/java-jee">Skills Matter Java &amp; JEE</a> events before and had thought them useful, so when I spotted the Selenium talk I thought I'd go along and see what I could gain from it.  My previous experience with <a href="http://selenium.openqa.org/">Selenium</a> had involved the <a href="http://selenium-ide.openqa.org/">Selenium IDE</a> for firefox and recording various scripts to be used as a very basic regression suite - intended to be ran after a new deployment to a live server to ensure that the deployment hadn't broken anything and that response times were acceptable.  So, I felt my knowledge was pretty basic and that this event should broaden my appreciation of the various aspects of Selenium as a tool.<p />The evening was broken into 3 parts, presented by 3 people and in total lasting an hour and a half, from 6.30pm to around 8pm.  <p />Part One was an introduction to Selenium by <a href="http://gojko.net/">Gojko Adzic</a> and introduced the concepts and associated tools.  Gojko has put together a <a href="http://gojko.net/2008/08/28/links-and-slides-from-testing-web-applications-with-selenium/">blog entry</a> detailing all the links he mentioned, and also links to the other speakers.  From this introduction I heard about a few tools I didn't know off:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://storytestiq.solutionsiq.com/wiki/Main_Page">StoryTestIQ</a> - a mashup of Selenium and <a href="http://www.fitnesse.org/FitNesse.OneMinuteDescription">FitNesse</a> which sounds like it is more tester friendly but with the ability to script database access for setup and teardown tasks</li>
<li><a href="http://fitnesse.info/webtest">WebTest Fixtures</a> - an extension to FitNesse that implement a customer-friendly language for web testing, utilising Selenium Remote Control</li>
</ul>
<p><br />Part Two was Milan Bogdanovic, a tester from <a href="http://www.sqs-uk.com/">SQS-UK</a>.  This talk focussed on the Selenium IDE, which, as I mentioned above, is the only bit of Selenium I've every really played with and so I didn't gain as much from this part.  I did, however, learn about the ability to use XPath expressions as the target and also got pointed at a useful Firefox extension <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1095">XPath Checker</a> to help work out the correct XPath expression for an element to check or select.  I also found out about the ability to make use of the <a href="http://wiki.openqa.org/display/SEL/Contributed+User-Extensions">user-extensions.js</a> file to store javascript functions and execute them via the IDE.<p />Part Three was <a href="http://www.isanchez.net/">Ivan Sanchez</a> and was focussed on <a href="http://selenium-rc.openqa.org/">Selenium RC</a>.  As with Gojko he has put together a <a href="http://isanchez.net/2008/08/29/slides-from-my-talk-at-skillsmatter/">blog post of links based on his session</a>.  I knew very little about this, although I knew that <a href="http://robochick.co.uk/">Emily</a> had made some good progress using it.   There were quite a few hints and tips coming out of this session, many relating to the architecting of the tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ideally start a new browser for each test - this ensures a clean base, but does make the process slow</li>
<li>Extract configuration details into an external properties file - otherwise, as with all other areas of development, your code ends up littered with "special" values</li>
<li>Make use of the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/webdriver/wiki/PageObjects">PageObjects</a> design pattern which presents each page as an object comprised of the services that the page offers - thus decoupling the HTML elements from the functional elements</li>
<li>Think carefully about when and how often these tests get run, as mentioned above they can be slow to execute so don't put them into a continuous integration environment to be run at each check-in, instead do them in batch overnight or a couple of times during the day</li>
<li>Consider using the <a href="http://selenium-grid.openqa.org/">Selenium Grid</a> option to perform the tests across multiple machines to reduce the time to execute - <a href="http://selenium-grid.openqa.org/run_the_demo_on_ec2.html">this can also work using Amazon's EC2 service</a></li>
</ul>
<p><br />All in all a good evening, well worth attending and I'll be keeping an eye on future events being run by Skills Matter as part of the <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/go/open-source-dot-net">Open Source .NET</a> series</p>
