    <p>I spotted this whilst browsing through a catalogue that had dropped through the letterbox. This is basically what I'm attempting to do, only retrospectively, for Mum. If Mum had one of these through her life and had recorded thoughts, images and emotions about significant (or insignificant for that matter) dates, that would have been a great help!</p></div>
