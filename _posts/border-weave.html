<p><a href="http://film.britishcouncil.org/border-weave">Border weave</a> is a <a href="http://film.britishcouncil.org/british-council-film-collection">British Council Film</a> dating from 1941 made to show the production of Scottish wool.</p>
<p>At about 10 minutes in it tells me:</p>

<p>It is a lovely film, and gives a great overview of what happened between sheep and shop in Scotland in the 1940s. Well worth the 15 minutes it takes to watch.</p>
