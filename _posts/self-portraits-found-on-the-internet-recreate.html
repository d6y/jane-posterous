<p>O’Donoghue tells us,</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><p>The process of painting from these images is slow and methodical, firstly dissecting the image into sections on paper and then working over periods of weeks or months to reconstruct the image section by section as a painting. Echoing and playing with the nature digital image processing and compression algorithms, the painting process is highly analytical and methodical and yet filled with randomness and inviting of errors, misalignments and glitches.</p></blockquote>

    <p>There is something quite amazing about this. Finding somebody you don't knows self portrait, contacting them for permission, and then expending hours and hours of effort reproducing it via a different medium.</p></div>
