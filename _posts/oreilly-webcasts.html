<p>Not sure how I'd missed this, but amongst the <a href="http://oreilly.com/events/">events</a> that O'Reilly put on are a lot of free webcasts. I've "attended" a couple in the last few weeks and they've both been good quality with a reasonably interactive group chat facility.&nbsp;So that I don't miss out on any more, I've created a <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=71d0a80c81104e8a5b22f86c593006e4">simple yahoo pipe that checks the events page RSS feed, and tells me of those which are webcasts</a>. I've simply subscribed to my <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=71d0a80c81104e8a5b22f86c593006e4&amp;_render=rss">yahoo pipes RSS feed</a> and can then pick which ones I want to "attend"</p>
