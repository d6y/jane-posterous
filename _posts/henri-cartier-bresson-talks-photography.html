<p>Here&rsquo;s a terrific 20-minute video that features <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_cartier-bresson">Henri Cartier-Bresson</a> &mdash; the father of modern photojournalism &mdash; talking about his views on photography and a selection of his amazing photographs. It&rsquo;s both educational and inspiring.</p>

<p>The decisive moment, it is the simultaneous recognition, in a fraction of a second, of the significance of an event as well as the precise organization of forms which gives that event its proper expression.</p>

<p>If only there was one of these videos for every famous historical photographer!</p>

<p>Recorded in 1973 this is a great combination of photography and instruction with a large amount of inspiration thrown in for good measure</p>
<p>Update: The video seems to have gone away - what a shame!</p>
