<h3>
<strong> </strong>Defensive Database Programming</h3>
<strong> </strong>
<h3>By Alex Kuznetsov</h3>
<p>The goal of Defensive Programming is to produce resilient code that responds gracefully to the unexpected.</p>
<p>To the SQL Server programmer, this means T-SQL code that behaves consistently and predictably in cases of unexpected usage, doesn't break under concurrent loads, and survives predictable changes to database schemas and settings.</p>
<p>Inside this book, you will find dozens of practical, defensive programming techniques that will improve the quality of your T-SQL code and increase its resilience and robustness.</p>

<p>Defensive SQL is something I've <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/?sort=&amp;search=defensive+sql">nattered about before</a> and this morning FatherJack <a href="http://twitter.com/fatherjack/status/18766780241">tweeted</a> about his <a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/community/blogs/jonathanallen/archive/2010/07/17/93535.aspx">blog review</a> of this free eBook, so I thought I'd better check it out.  I haven't done much more than flick through the contents page, but at a glimpse it looks like it'll have some helpful hints and tips.</p>
