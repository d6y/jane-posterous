<p>I went to my 3rd <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/tag/photogroup">photo group</a> meetup a couple of weeks ago.  The theme, brought forward from January's cancelled meetup, was photos in the style of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Mann">Sally Mann</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Cartier-Bresson">Henri Cartier-Bresson</a>, and general Christmas photos.<p />I failed in the Sally Mann and Henri Cartier-Bresson theme, but did bring along some Christmas themed photos - mainly <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/tag/lego">Lego Santa</a> related but I also put together a triptych of photos (a continuing theme from the November meetup) from the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157613253224417/">recent snow</a> which seemed to be liked by the group.<p /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<p />Next months theme is, well, there is no theme.  Just a chance to bring along 10 or so favourite photos which will be good to us new members to get an idea of what the others are all about</p>
