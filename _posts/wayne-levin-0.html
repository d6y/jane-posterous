<p>This spectacular appreciation of akule life, where art  and reportage tremble together in<br /> each image, re-opens the door to a world that much of  humanity long ago turned its back on in order to pursue forms of wealth far  more perishable, less elegant, and more banal.&nbsp;  Wayne Levin&rsquo;s attention here is on biology, but the ramifications of  what he captures in the schooling patterns of these fish prompt, with the force  of lightning bolts, thoughts about everything from astronomy to community  organization. <br /> &ndash;Barry Lopez</p>

<p>Almost a couple of years ago I blogged about <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/wayne-levin-5">Wayne Levin</a> and his <a href="http://www.waynelevinimages.com/">amazing underwater photography</a>. I received an email from Wayne a month or so ago letting me know that he has a <a href="https://www.hawaiipublisher.com/sku029C_presale.htm">book coming out</a> featuring lots of these wonderful photos, and even better, it is still on a pre-sale price of $30.</p>
