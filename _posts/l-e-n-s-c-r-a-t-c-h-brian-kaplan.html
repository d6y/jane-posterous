      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>There’s something surreal about a blank billboard at night -- the simple, glowing rectangle against a dark night sky.</p><p> A billboard is an advertisement.  Like all advertisements, a billboard tells us what we should buy, feeding our consumption-obsessed culture.  </p><p> But a blank billboard seems to turn the traditional goal of advertising on its head, instead telling us:  “Live simply.  Real fullfillment is something you cannot buy.”</p><p></p></blockquote><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://lenscratch.blogspot.com/2011/01/brian-kaplan.html">lenscratch.blogspot.com</a></div>
