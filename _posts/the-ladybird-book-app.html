<p>I read about the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ladybird-classic-me-books/id453238220?mt=8">Ladybird Classic Me Books app</a> the other day via <a href="http://www.theliteraryplatform.com/2011/09/ladybird-me-books-app/">The Literary Platform</a> and persuaded Richard to part company with the 69p needed to buy it for the iPad.  He did so, and above is video of him showing it to the dog.</p>
<p>One side note here: Very few apps/tv shows/recorded voices get any reaction whatsoever from Skitters, so her reaction here was both surprising and amusing</p>
<p>I remember the Ladybird books from my childhood, and always have a sense of trepidation looking at new interpretations of things I grew up loving. But I have to say I'm rather impressed - it's very simply done, with simple touch interaction to get animal noises, or the words read out, via a simple hot spot map (which can be made visible) and then the ability to record your own voice on it meaning that a parent who can't always be at their child's bedside at story time, can still be part of that routine.</p>
<p>Also, more than a little eager to persuade Richard to part with a further &pound;1.99 so I can listen to one of the Adam Buxton narrated stories</p>
