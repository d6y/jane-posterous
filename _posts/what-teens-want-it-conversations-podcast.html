I listened to an excellent <a href="http://www.itconversations.com">IT Conversations</a> podcast this morning - <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail862.html">What Teens Want</a>. Taken from the <a href="http://www.web2con.com/">Web 2.0</a> 2005 conference, it featured a panel of teenagers answering questions on their internet habits, what sites they spent lots of time on (<a href="http://www.myspace.com/">myspace</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">facebook</a>), how they chatted with their friends (<a href="http://www.aim.com/">AIM</a> mainly) and how they found music.  Really interesting to hear what 17-18 year olds see as important - their prime concern seems to be what can they get for free, although at least one of them is happy to spend $50 - $60 per month on ring tones for his phone.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-116115886446689577?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
