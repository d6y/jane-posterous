<p>No sooner had <a href="http://afreshcup.com/">Mike Gunderloy</a> <a href="http://www.larkware.com/dg9/TheDailyGrind1305.aspx">finished</a> posting <a href="http://www.larkware.com/">The Daily Grind</a>, a daily round-up of all that was new and good in the (mostly) .NET arena but also touching on other software development related material, than <a href="http://blog.cwa.me.uk/author/chris/">Chris Alcock</a> took over with <a href="http://blog.cwa.me.uk/tags/morning-brew/">The Morning Brew</a>.  He produced the <a href="http://blog.cwa.me.uk/2008/05/23/the-morning-brew-100/">100th installment</a> last week, so Well done Chris.  This is one of my must read blogs, and I always find it is full of helpful, useful and informative links - including <a href="http://blog.cwa.me.uk/2008/01/07/the-morning-brew-4/">one</a> to <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/update-generate-insert-statement-from-table-f">this blog</a></p>
