<p>The <a href="http://www.petapixel.com">PetaPixel</a> site has compiled a list of  <a href="http://www.petapixel.com/2010/05/20/14-powerful-ted-talks-by-photographers/#">14 Powerful TED talks by Photographers</a>, and as a fan of both TED talks and photography this seemed like a great resource.  Having taken a look at the list, I realise that I've already watched a few of them (and have even included a couple of them myself as blog posts before [<a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/ted-talk-david-griffin-photography-connects-u">1</a>][<a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/ted-talk-rick-smolan-a-girl-a-photograph-a-ho">2</a>]) but there are still some there I haven't seen yet so I look forward to sitting back and watching them.</p>
