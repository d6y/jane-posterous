<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">As we amass an incredible amount of photos, it becomes increasingly difficult to manage our collections. Imagine if descriptive metadata about each photo could be appended to the image on the fly&mdash;information about who is in each photo, what they're doing, and their environment could become incredibly useful in being able to search, filter, and cross-reference our photo collections. Of course, we don't yet have the technology that makes this a practical proposition, but the Descriptive Camera explores these possibilities.</blockquote>

<p>I've been thinking about the value and importance of <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/tag/meta">meta-data</a> for a while, mainly in relation to my own <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/tag/storyline">storyline project</a> and how much I'm reliant on the hand-written annotations (which I'm classing as meta-data) of my Mum to help me place the physical photographs and items she had kept (hoarded might actually be a better word) in time and space.</p>
<p>As this seems to be an itch for me at the moment, I'm planning to do a bit more thinking and researching about this as I continue to explore the ideas and values of meta-data - probably mostly from a personal perspective, but hopefully with a brief foray towards the value for social historians etc as well.</p>
