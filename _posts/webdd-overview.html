I had a great day at <a href="http://www.webdd.org.uk/">WebDD</a> today and attended some good sessions - which I'll go into more later.  The <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/">Scott Guthrie</a> sessions were hugely over-subscribed, but were recorded so I hope to get a chance to see them at a later stage.  Initally not a lot of swag, but I got to leave with a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Microsoft-UCQ-00001-Expression-Web-PC/dp/B000IBZLA0/sr=8-2/qid=1170528101/ref=pd_ka_2/202-5211559-2720604?ie=UTF8&amp;s=software/richarddallaway">Expression Web</a> as well as a pen and some magazines.<p />The sessions I attended today were:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.webdd.org.uk/ViewSession.aspx?SessionID=66">Expression Web</a> - an excellent introduction to a tool which looks great</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.webdd.org.uk/ViewSession.aspx?SessionID=53">Doing it in style: creating beautiful sites, the web standards way</a> - a bit too much content for the hour, so I'm hoping to see the slides to review the bits that were skipped over</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.webdd.org.uk/ViewSession.aspx?SessionID=62">Quick and dirty Usability tests - one week, no budget, and no usability facility</a> - an interesting overview of usability testing - something I've never experienced</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.webdd.org.uk/ViewSession.aspx?SessionID=59">Ruby On Rails for .NET Developers</a> - excellent presentation, great looking tool and framework</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.webdd.org.uk/ViewSession.aspx?SessionID=61">Unobtrusive Javascript with Rails</a> - graceful degradation of javascript</li></ul><br />And so there ends my first ever conference, I'm not sure why but I've never managed to attend one before.  I'm definitely hoping to attend the next WebDD event, and also probably the <a href="http://www.developerday.co.uk/ddd/default.asp">DeveloperDeveloperDeveloper!</a> events too.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-149925390961027639?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
