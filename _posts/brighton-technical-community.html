Sometimes I forget how fortunate I am to live in a city which is so full of technical and new media focussed people.  We have a vibrant community of technologists, both in the real world and in the online world.<p />Mainly online with occasional meetups:<ul><br /><li><a href="http://www.brightonbloggers.com/blog/">Brighton Bloggers</a> - obviously top of the list as I maintain it :-)  It is A site listing all the bloggers in Brighton (that I know of) - currently running at 268 entries.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.brightonnewmedia.org/">Brighton New Media</a> - mailing list offering on topic and off topic conversations, covering topics from development, design through to tradesman recommendations.  Be warned, its pretty busy!</li></ul><br />Mainly meetups:<ul><br /><li><a href="http://sussex.geekdinner.co.uk/">Sussex Geek Dinner</a> - Simon organises the Geek Dinner for Sussex, and the last 3 or 4 have been based down in Brighton, offering speakers as well as conversation.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.brightongirlgeekdinners.co.uk/geekdinners/">Brighton Girl Geek Dinner</a> - In its infancy, but if the 1st event is anything to go by this could be a really successful venture.</li><br /><li><a href="http://brighton-ruby.org/">Brighton Ruby</a> - user group for Brighton Ruby developers</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.brightonfarm.com/">Brighton Farm</a> - a networking group for web designers, developers and people with related new media skills who live in Brighton and the surrounding areas</li><br /><li><a href="http://codingdojo.futureplatforms.com/">Coding Dojo</a> - in the two hour session, up to twelve developers take turns solving a programming problem</li></ul><br />Hopefully <a href="http://www.skillswap-brighton.org/skillswap/">SkillSwap</a> will <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/139742/">return</a> as well in the near future to the benefit of all again.<p />I'm sure that this isn't a conclusive list, but it does go to show how much of a technical community there is down here.  What a great place to live and geek :-)<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-3681521084067844310?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
