I've got a nice new wide angle lens to play with - the Sigma 10-20mm lens. I was debating getting the Nikon wide lens but the Sigma fits in well with my Nikon 18-200mm lens and a couple of guys at work also have the 10-20mm and rave about it. So far so good but I haven't played with it much yet preferring to use the 18-200mm and the flash unit for Christmas Day photography.<img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-4235906625359290855?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" />
