    <p>A couple of weeks ago <a href="http://justseventhings.com/">Simon</a> ran a "Top tips for communication" session in the <a href="http://madgex.com/">Madgex</a> offices.  One of the books he referred to was <a href="http://www.jellyeffect.com/">The Jelly Effect</a> by Andy Bounds (which I have downloaded the <a href="http://kindle.amazon.com/work/jelly-effect-make-communication-stick/B001JNVG6Y">sample for the kindle</a> app on my iPhone - I love the sample chapter thing, a great way to determine if it is a book I'm actually likely to read).  The other day whilst browsing the internet for more information on The Jelly Effect I stumbled across a set of videos by Andy Bounds explaining the various concepts.  Afters, the one linked to above, was the one that seemed most relevant to me right now.  The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=jelly+effect+andy+bounds&amp;aq=f">others can also be found at youtube</a>.  These are promotional videos, with the Afters of making us want to buy the book, but there is good substance in there too.</p></div>
