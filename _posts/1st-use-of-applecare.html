I've just had my first experience with <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/">AppleCare</a>.  My 1 year old <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/macbook/macbook.html">MacBook</a> lost all track of its battery - the little battery icon in the status bar showing X, when I plugged the power cable in the led just showed green at all times, and when I turned the laptop upside down and pressed the monitor button on the battery I got no little green lights - <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=397330&amp;tstart=0">others have had the same problem</a>.  <p />I called up AppleCare and tried a few things, installed an upgrade, turned off and on again whilst holding down a combination of keys, etc.  They suggested I take it to one of the service providers in my area to let them determine if it was a battery or a connection problem.  Instead I trotted off down to <a href="http://www.solutions-inc.co.uk/">Solutions Inc</a> and the guys in there kindly let me try one of their batteries and pleasingly it all worked without a problem.  So, on Monday morning I called AppleCare back and told them what I'd tried.  End result, a shiny new battery which arrived today and I now have a laptop which is no longer tethered to the mains :-)<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-3510169532305689986?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
