Since getting my iPod Touch for Christmas I've been investigating some of the Lightroom tutorial videocasts.  I've had a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Adobe-Photoshop-Lightroom-Book-Photographers/dp/0321385438/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=gateway&amp;qid=1201550974&amp;sr=8-1">The Adobe Photoshop Lightroom Book: The Complete Guide for Photographers</a> but still haven't had a lot of time to sit down and read through it. <p />These are the podcasts I've been watching:<ul><li><a href="http://lightroom-news.com/category/lightroom/lightroom-podcasts/">Adobe Photoshop Lightroom</a> with <a href="http://www.mulita.com/blog/">George Jadine</a> - tutorials are interspersed with interviews and portfolio reviews, but the tutorials are of a very high standard and are very informative although mostly focussed on the develop module</li><li><a href="http://www.lightroomkillertips.com/archives/videos/">Adobe Photoshop Lightroom Killer Tips</a> - mostly short videos giving hints and tips</li><li><a href="http://www.thedigitalphotographyconnection.com/">Lightroom for digital photographers</a> with <a href="http://www.photographerscanvas.com/">Michael Rather</a>.  This is a regularly updated podcast covering a wide range of subjects</li></ul><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-2889085556512279307?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
