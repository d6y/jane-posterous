Last night I attended my first <a href="http://skillswap.brightonnewmedia.org/">Skillswap</a> event.  These are free events where the emphasis is on learning a new skill, and presented by a local expert.  It was presented by Matt Zandstra (author of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0672323117/richarddallaway">Sams Teach Yourself PHP in 24 Hours</a>) and was all about PHP, Objects and Patterns.  Matt also delved into some of the new features that PHP5 will provide when it's released towards the end of this year.<br /><p>I must admit that <a href="http://hillside.net/patterns/">Design Patterns</a> are something that have been on the fringe of my knowledge for a long time, but that I've just never got around to learning more about, so it is good to now have a bit more of an idea.  There were a couple of book recommendations mentioned during the night - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201633612/richarddallaway">Design patterns : elements of reusable object-oriented software</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262561158/richarddallaway">A Little Java, a Few Patterns</a> which I may have to take a closer look at.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-115816525117567358?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div></p>
