<p>I read the article <a href="http://m.gizmodo.com/5649180/22-experiments-with-disposable-cameras">22 experiments with disposable cameras</a> the other day, which reminded me about the <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/madgex-photography-workshop-2">2nd Madgex Photography challenge</a> I set which was based around disposable cameras.</p>
<p>The challenge for Madgex was good, everyone in the group had a digital camera of some sort, even if it was their mobile phone, and nobody had shot with film for a while, and definitely not a disposable camera.  It got people thinking, which is never a bad thing.</p>
<p>My set of hastily put together <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157623561782245/">photos are on flickr</a>, they're not great, but I did do them in about 30 minutes between the office and Colourstream (my <a href="http://colourstream.net/">photography lab</a> of choice).</p>
<p>I really like some of the photographs that were submitted as part of <a href="http://m.gizmodo.com/5649180/22-experiments-with-disposable-cameras">the Gizmodo challenge</a> and am really impressed with the lengths some people went to:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">I took a Fujifilm Quicksnap flash 400 apart a little to get to the lens and shutter, I tied a small piece of string around the shutter so I could have a bulb setting.</blockquote>
The full set of submissions for that challenge are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gizmodo/sets/72157625047067038/">on flickr here</a> but here are a couple of my favourites: <br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gizmodo/5030239205/" title="FionaConnDisposableWallpaper by gizmodoprime, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4131/5030239205_ee75d89ec1_m.jpg" height="150" alt="FionaConnDisposableWallpaper" width="240" /></a> <br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gizmodo/5030855810/" title="DavidNemersonDisposableWallpaper by gizmodoprime, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4109/5030855810_aee533c913_m.jpg" height="159" alt="DavidNemersonDisposableWallpaper" width="240" /></a>
