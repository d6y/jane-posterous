<p>and in a hotel room...</p>
<p>I was in Hull over the weekend visiting my Mum, and I took my flower loom with me to help pass the time. When I visited Mum I noticed that whilst she had a lot of Christmas cards around the place, there weren't any decorations, so I decided to make her some Christmassy flowers (fortunately I'd packed my metallic white cotton). I decided to make 5 of them, and that I'd find some way of stringing them together in her room - I ended up using a piece of cotton and the thumb tacks on her cork board. &nbsp;Here they are before being strung together, in poor light, using an iPhone camera, and using my jumper as a background - not ideal photographic conditions but they're an illustration at least.</p>

<p>Each of these flowers was 6 rounds of cotton, and then finished off by stitching through the middle and a gap left by the weaving of the cotton for the petals. There was then some backstitching done around the outside before another round of middle to gap stitching.</p>
<p>On the train on the way home I started making some flowers for me, these are the first set that I have an actual planned project for, rather than purely being experimental. Last year I got a grey scarf which is thick and warm, but a bit dull. My intention is to brighten it up with flowers. I'd originally planned to use some of the pink cotton I bought for the first experimental flowers, but then saw and fell in love with these two blues (these are the same <a href="http://www.debbieblissonline.com/Yarn.asp?yid=39">brand/range</a> as last time). I made the 4 big ones on the train, and this morning did 2 small ones using the same colours but transposed.</p>
<p>Here's the final small one, still on the flower loom with 2 large ones and one finished small one behind it.</p>

<p>Whilst making these flowers, I've been making use of my Girl Guide knotting skills, by attaching the cotton to the loom by a <a href="https://mail.madgex.com/exchange/">clove hitch</a>&nbsp;which has worked well, and stopped me having to hang on to it.</p>
<p>So, all that's left is to sew them onto the scarf...</p>
