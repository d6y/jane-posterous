I was amused to read a <a href="http://blog.flickr.net/en">Flickr Blog post</a> the other day about <a href="http://blog.flickr.net/en/2008/09/23/adventures-in-flickr-biking/">bikes which automatically create a photographic map of where theyâ€™ve been</a>.  Especially as <a href="http://startwearingpurple.yahoo.com/#/pedals/europe/2">one of them is in Brighton</a> and has <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/lomokevs_bike/">it's own flickr stream</a>.  It seems to be a great combination of bike and gps, and reading what <a href="http://flickr.com/people/lomokevs_bike/">Lomokev's bike's profile</a> says it uploads the photos automatically to flickr every 60 seconds.  There is also a <a href="http://startwearingpurple.yahoo.com/#/pedals/making_of">making of video</a> which gives a few more details.<p />The latest photo from Lomokev's bike is:<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-1822697761945646207?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
