<p>The criteria we've come up for choosing a <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/static-code-analysisl">Static Code Analysis</a> tool are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Integration</strong> - how well does it integrate with VS2005. Does it claim to integrate with VS2008?  What about legacy VS2003 stuff?</li>
<li><strong>Versions</strong> - can it work against a .NET 1 project? Or a .NET 3/3.5 one?</li>
<li><strong>Ease of use</strong> - how easy is it to run an analysis? How easy is it to understand what it wants you to fix? And where the code is?</li>
<li><strong>Ease of configuration</strong> - how easy is it to add a new rule? Or turn one off?</li>
<li><strong>Issue detection</strong> - running it against a specific project, what does it detect? How many potential issues does it spot? How does this compare the other tools?</li>
<li><strong>Stability</strong> - any problems noticed since installing it/using it?</li>
<li><strong>Extra</strong> - what else is there about this tool? Any added bonuses?</li>
</ul>
<p><br />Is there anything else we should be thinking about?  <p />Note: We've excluded cost as we're interested in finding the right tool without thinking about budgetary constraints.</p>
