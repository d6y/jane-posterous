<p>Another lunchtime, another photography exhibition. &nbsp;This time just around the corner from the office, <a href="http://www.bpb.org.uk/exhibitions/9009/bpb-curated-the-house-of-vernacular/">The House of Vernacular</a> at <a href="http://fabrica.org.uk/">Fabrica</a>. First, a disclaimer, I love the Fabrica space, I've enjoyed several exhibitions there, and even a wedding reception.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd heard mixed reviews about this exhibition, some people loved it, some didn't seem too impressed.</p>
<p>I think I need to go and see it again to get the most out of it. &nbsp;One downside with lunchtime exhibition viewing is that my head is still full of work stuff, so I dashed through a few of the 7 exhibits, before calming down and taking my time to enjoy.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.bpb.org.uk/exhibitions/9009/bpb-curated-the-house-of-vernacular/">exhibition is described </a>as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The House of Vernacular is an installation of dreamlike architecture within which seven diverse collections of vernacular photography by commercial and non-professional photographers from around the world are intimately located:<p />&bull; Photo Paintings from North East Brazil collected by Titus Riedl.<br />&bull; The Corinthians featuring amateur American family snapshots, 1947 to 1974. Archive of Modern Conflict.<br />&bull; Litter Bins from the Design Council Picture Library, 1950s and 1960s. University of&nbsp;Brighton Design Archives.<br />&bull; Wirtschaftswunder by&nbsp;<strong>Josef Heinrich Darchinger</strong>&nbsp;(DEU) shot for The German Ministry of the Interior, during the cold war period. Archive of Modern Conflict.<br />&bull; Aeroplane Interiors showing the luxury of African dictators&rsquo; private jets, 1960s and 1970s. This selection includes a series of images taken by&nbsp;<strong>Nick Gleis</strong>. Archive of Modern Conflict.<br />&bull; Men in Hats, street photographs from Bogota. Archive of Modern Conflict.<br />&bull; Babies and Children portraits by commercial photographer Lee To Sang, 1970s&nbsp;and&nbsp;1980s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My favourite of these exhibits, based on my rushed visit, has to be the "Litter Bins from the Design Council Picture Library", as yet again, it appeals to my sense of the mundane.</p>

<p>I think I will plan to return and spend more (restful) time there over the next few weeks</p>
