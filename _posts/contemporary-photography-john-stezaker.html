This evening I attended a talk as part of a series on <a href="http://www.photoworksuk.org/participation/present/details.asp?ID=48">Contemporary Photography</a> being staged by <a href="http://www.photoworksuk.org/index.htm">Photoworks</a> in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.brighton.ac.uk/arts/programmes/comm-media-arts/pdf/ma-photo.pdf">MA Photography course</a> of the <a href="http://www.brighton.ac.uk/">University of Brighton</a>.<p /><a href="http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/artists/john_stezaker.htm">John Stezaker</a> isn't an artist I've come across before, but from this talk I felt I got a really good understanding of the evolution of his works, where he started from, and how his more recent work (the marriage and betrayal series) builds on his work of the past.  As with the <a href="http://schmid.wordpress.com/">Joachim Schmid</a> exhibition <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/2007/06/squirrel.html">I saw last year</a> at the <a href="http://www.photonet.org.uk/index.php?latest">Photographers Gallery</a> there still seems something slightly sacrilegious to me about the deliberate destruction of photographs, even to then use these elements to produce something more.  In fact, a member of the audience this evening asked John about this, and John accepted this, and said that he couldn't use photos of his family or loved ones in this manner, but was more than comfortable using film stock and postcards.  He mentioned that he liked using damaged photographs, and has also used postcards and images from his own past - postcards from his parents when he was a little boy, a picture of Queen Victoria from a book that he scribbled all over as a child.<p />John recorded a <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/triennial/video.shtm#stezaker">video interview</a> with Tate Britain for <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/triennial/">Tate Triennial 2006</a> which gives a flavour of the content of his talk.<p />There are three more talks in the series, all being held at the <a href="http://www.brightonquakers.co.uk/">Friends Meeting House</a> in Brighton over the next 3 Wednesday evenings.
