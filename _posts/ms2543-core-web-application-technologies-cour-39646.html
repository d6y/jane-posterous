My team have been given a new project to work on, which is improvements to the current functionality offered by an ASP.NET 2/C# product.  To this end, we've highlighted a couple of courses as a way to get up to speed to enable us to maintain and enhance this product going forward.<p /><a href="http://www.xpertise.co.uk/index.aspx?pageID=1">Xpertise</a> have come into the office, and we've taken over the boardroom to have a week long course covering both the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/syllabi/en-us/2543bfinal.mspx">Core Web Application Technologies</a>, and the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/syllabi/en-us/2544afinal.mspx">Advanced Web Application Technologies</a> workshops.<p />Yesterday was the first day of the course, and covered off several of the basics, covering the creation of a web application using a file system web server, doing some basic programming, handling errors nicely and also starting to look into using server controls and the use of postback.<p />So far I'm enjoying it, and its starting to make the source code that I looked at last week for the new product far easier to understand.  My last forray into web development using Microsoft tools was back in 2003 when I last did some ASP work.  I'm hoping to be able to lead by example and do some development as well as recommendations and design work.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-116471202522970831?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
