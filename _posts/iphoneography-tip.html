A tip I read from one of the iPhone street photographers was to have the camera app running and then turn the iPhone off when you're done. This means that when you need to take a photo then all you have to do is turn the phone back on and the camera app will be ready. I tried this today with hipstamatic and found it to be great advice, especially given the load time for the app. Well worth trying sometime.
