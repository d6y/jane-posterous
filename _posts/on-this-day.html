<p>On 25th March 1933, 79 years ago today, my Grandma and Granddad got married.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's my Grandma:<br /> <img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7114/6867678934_6519ece8b6.jpg" height="500" alt="Wedding: Sally Ann and John" width="356" /></p>

<p>The cutting from the newspaper (which was sent to relatives in the US who sent it back to us a few years ago):<br /><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7273/7013788563_5cb988bd77_b.jpg" height="1024" alt="Wedding: Sally Ann and John" width="374" /></p>
<p>Fast forward 40 years, and here's a photo from their Ruby wedding anniversary, this time including my Mum and me:<br /><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7180/7013800347_0568a84f89.jpg" height="318" alt="mum-jane-grandparents-25-march-1973" width="500" /></p>
<p>This last photo is the subject of the&nbsp;<a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/timeline-and-storyline-postcards">postcard</a> I'm planning to send to Mum later today. Without scanning and starting to organise all of these assets I wouldn't have been able to pull this post together. It reminds me, again, that doing Mum's <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/tag/storyline">storyline</a> project isn't just for her benefit. I gain hugely from it too.</p>
