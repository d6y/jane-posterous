On Wednesday evening, after I left the <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/2008/04/contemporary-photography-lydia-yee.html">Contemporary Photography : Lydia Yee</a> talk at the Friends Meeting House I made my way along to the Black Horse for a <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/463325/">Geek Dinner</a>.  The speaker was <a href="http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/">Mike Hadlow</a>, who I worked with for a while at Madgex late last year.<p />He gave a <a href="http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2008/04/last-night-sussex-geek-dinner.html">talk about Inversion of Control</a>, a talk that he'd given previously at <a href="http://www.developerday.co.uk/ddd/agendaddd6.asp">DDD6 last November</a>.   He has posted <a href="http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2008/04/last-night-sussex-geek-dinner.html">some links</a> over at his <a href="http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/">blog</a>.<p />The audience was more technical than usual, and a few usual faces were missing, possibly put off by the content.  However, some new faces were also there, probably attracted by a more technical talk.  All in all, another good evening organised by <a href="http://harriyott.com/">Simon</a>.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-2741825045600069727?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
