<p>So, the first period of <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/ideas-and-learning-project">ILP</a> time is over, and I've managed to use 50-60 hours of my allocation attending workshops, watching presentations, learning stuff and doing ideas project work.<br /> <em>Learning</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Started reading through the <a href="http://www.opera.com/wsc/">Opera web standards curriculum</a> to ensure my knowledge was up to date</li>
<li>Attended various presentations including: Stress Management, Zen and the craft of software development, Introduction to unit testing with nUnit, CSS3: Third time's the charm, Comet (a presentation by <a href="http://simonwillison.net/">Simon Willson</a> who came in kindly to talk to us), Basic NLP and hypnosis, SQL Server Advanced, Vision and Goal setting, Theories of Management and Javascript inheritance</li>
</ul>
<p><br /> <em>Ideas</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Looked into <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dbverse/">DBVerse</a>, a database deployment tool, to see if this would help us.  Review <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/database-change-management-dbverse-review">here</a></li>
<li>Looked into <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tarantino/wiki/DatabaseChangeManagement">Tarantino</a>, another database deployment tool.  Review <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/database-change-management-tarantino-review">here</a></li>
<li>Worked with <a href="http://siliconbea.ch/">Bruce</a> to start writing a database deployment tool to meet our specific requirements.  This is still ongoing and will continue into the next few months</li>
<li>Attended <a href="http://madgex.com/news/2008/madgex-hackday-3/">Hackday 3</a> and worked on some keyword searching work with Chris</li>
<li>Looked into <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/sourceanalysis">Stylecop</a>, a code style analyser.  Review <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/stylecop">here</a></li>
</ul>
<p><br /> Now I have to start planning out the next years allocation - I'm cashing in a couple of days to attend the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/uk/remix08/">ReMix UK conference</a>, I'm going to continue attending <a href="http://justseventhings.com/">Simon</a>'s management and leadership courses, as well as his NLP related ones.  I'm also hosting 2 sessions in the next month - one which is SQL Snap, based on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/janed/1352499862/">CSS Specificity snap</a> and one which is an experimental SQL Coding dojo.  I'm sure I'll report back on both of these afterwards.</p>
