I listened to the excellent <a href="http://digiphoto.thepodcastnetwork.com/2007/04/18/the-digital-photography-show-47-how-to-tell-a-story-in-pictures-with-bobbie-lane/">47th Digital Photography Show</a> the other day and was really impressed with the conversation they had with <a href="http://www.bobbilane.com/">Bobbi Lane</a>.  Most of the interview was about using photography to tell a story, and it was really inspiring, it really made me think about a lot of things.  She offers her services for teaching, and what came across in the chat was how good a teacher she must be.  An excellent episode of the podcast.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-653862269184072651?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
