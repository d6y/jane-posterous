<p>On Thursday I popped along to <a href="http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/31/3137/Sussex/Hove">The Sussex</a> to attend my 2nd photo group meetup.  Myself, and 2 other ladies from the <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/creative-digital-photography-day-1">Creative Digital Photography Course</a>, have joined a long running group who all did the same course about 2 years ago.<p />Every month there is a theme, and you're encouraged to bring along 10 or so photos that match the theme.  This month the theme was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triptych">Triptych</a>, a series of 3 photographs that worked together.  I decided to use some of the photos from <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157609466182815/">Lewes Bonfire</a> and headed down to Boots to get them processed (we present them in print form which is really rather pleasant).  I only managed one set of 3, but will try and do better another time.  I also decided that I wanted to take the photos during the month and not ravage the archives.<p /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<p />As a three I'm quite happy with these as I'm not sure any one of them is strong enough to give a strong enough impression of the sheer madness, and amazingness of Lewes Bonfire.  I'm not sure they manage it as a 3 to be honest.  I was really pleased with the feedback I got, and I was delighted with the printed reproductions from Boots.<p />The second bit of preparation we'd done was to look through historic photographers to find a photographer we wanted to emulate for next month.  I sat down and went through my <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Icons-Photography-Century-Peter-Stepan/dp/3791333364/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1226147950&amp;sr=1-1">Icons of Photography: The 20th Century</a> book and came up with 4 photographers who's work gave me that feeling of wow!  They were (in probably loosely chronological order):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Auerbach">Ellen Auerbach</a> - specifically for the photo <a href="http://www.clemusart.com/Explore/artistwork.asp?artistLetter=R&amp;recNo=105&amp;woRecNo=0">Eckstein with Lipstick</a> which I found to be striking and playful</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_&amp;Aacute;lvarez_Bravo">Manuel Alvarez Bravo</a> - with the photo <a href="http://www.artnet.com/galleries/Artwork_Detail.asp?G=&amp;gid=911&amp;which=&amp;aid=668040&amp;wid=424211037&amp;source=inventory&amp;rta=http://www.artnet.com">The Dreamer</a> which made me feel like a first hand observer and is shot with  beautiful lighting and contrast</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Salomon">Erich Salomon</a>, one of the first photo journalists - with <a href="http://www.fotomuseum.ch/presse/0512_Salomon/06.AristideBriand.jpg">Ah, le voil&agrave;! Le roi des indiscrets</a> which is a wonderful capture of a moment with a sense of fun and humour</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Rodchenko">Alexander M. Rodchenko</a> - for <a href="http://www.stevenkasher.com/html/Detail.asp?WorkInvNum=1190&amp;whatpage=artist">Trumpet-playing pioneer</a> which appeals for its unusual angle and cropping and great lighting</li>
</ul>
<p>I still haven't got beyond 1955 in my reading of the book, so I'm sure there will be some more to add to this list.<p />Other people suggested <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Mann">Sally Mann</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Cartier-Bresson">Henri Cartier-Bresson</a>.<p />So the themes for the next meetup are images in the style of Sally Mann, Henri Cartier-Bresson and a Christmas shot.  I'd better get studying and take some more photos!</p>
