<p>Following on from <a href="http://softhook.com/">Christian Nold</a>'s excellent <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/geekyoto-christian-nold">talk</a> at <a href="http://geekyoto.com">Geekyoto</a> I got to thinking about other uses of emotional mapping, not just restricting it to a geographical model as per <a href="http://www.emotionmap.net/">the Greenwich emotion map</a>.<p />Then yesterday afternoon, I was doing some bug fixing on some ugly, ugly code and wondered what my "<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2006/apr/16/news.theobserversuknewspages">arousal level</a>" would be as per Christian's maps.  I thought it would probably be in the zone of high arousal implying stress, and wondered if mapping the code emotionally would be a good way of working out which areas to concentrate on when re-factoring and reworking.  I'm not sure how practical it would be to operate as rarely does one sit down and read code.<p />Thoughts?</p>
