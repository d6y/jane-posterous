<p>Today I finally had the opportunity to do something that had been on my todo list for a while - move the collection of <a href="https://github.com/janedallaway/SQL-Server-Helper-Scripts">SQL Server Helper Scripts</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="https://github.com/janedallaway/Kindle-Helper-Scripts">Kindle annotations to text file</a>&nbsp;applescript I wrote into a proper repository. I hope that it will make it easier for other people to make changes and enhance the scripts rather than having to email me updates/leave me comments on requirements etc.</p>
<p>I chose <a href="https://github.com/">github</a> as it seemed to be the most frequently used repository amongst my colleagues and friends, and because I haven't really used git much before so thought it would be a good way to get some exposure to it (and so far a combination of the help text provided and a husband who knows his way about git seems to be working).</p>
<p>I'm going to spend a little time going back through the various blog posts to try and get the links all hooked up to the right place, but as with everything else around here, there are no guarantees I'll catch them all.</p>
