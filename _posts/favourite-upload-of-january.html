<p>In January I uploaded <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/archives/date-posted/2010/01/">126 photos</a>.<p />I know I posted this image just <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/ladder-in-the-light">the other day</a>, but I think it has to be my favourite for January.  I like the darkness leading you into the image.  I like the simplicity of the subject.  I'm surprised by the quality of image I managed to wrangle out of my iPhone using just the <a href="http://www.sudobility.com/Night%20Camera.html">night camera application</a>, the <a href="http://www.themill.com/colourapp/">mill colour application</a> and the <a href="http://mobile.photoshop.com/iphone/">adobe photoshop mobile application</a>.<p />This photo has also got me thinking a lot about the style of photographs I like - and black and white minimalist photos are ranking pretty high and consequently I have been enjoying looking through the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/minimal_black_and_white/pool/">Minimal Black&amp;White flickr pool</a>.</p>
