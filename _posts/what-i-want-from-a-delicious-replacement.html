<p>I started using <a href="http://www.delicious.com/">delicious</a> many years ago and have built up quite a collection of (mostly) tagged bookmarks. With the (now confirmed) <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/16/is-yahoo-shutting-down-del-icio-us/">rumours of delicious being shut down</a> doing the rounds I've <a href="http://mattcrampton.com/delicious/">exported my data</a> in preparation for a change of service and started thinking about what I currently want from a bookmarking service, and here is what I've come up with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to tag my bookmarks&nbsp;</li>
<li>Ability to export my bookmarks annotated with tags (and notes if appropriate)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Ability to import my delicious bookmarks keeping the tags and notes</li>
<li>Ability to bookmark pages from a browser via a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet">bookmarklet</a></li>
<li>Ability to bookmark an article from my RSS reader (<a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/">google reader</a> on my laptop/work PC and <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> on my iPhone)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Ability to bookmark a page through <a href="http://www.instapaper.com">instapaper</a> on the iPhone (currently I use <a href="http://ping.fm/">ping.fm</a> to do this for delicious via email which is a bit of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kludge">kludge</a>)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Ability to search through my bookmarks to re-locate a site based on tag or notes&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not too bothered about the social networking side of things with my bookmarks so I don't really have any requirements around this at the moment. I tend to read most content currently via Reeder or Instapaper, both of which have email capacity so I tend to fire off an email containing the link and annotations to relevant people, or even copy and paste the link into a tweet where appropriate. &nbsp;I don't feel the need to create yet another social presence at this time.</p>
<p>So, what next? I'm going to start by reading through the <a href="http://bit.ly/fXzuPw">suggestions made via this collaborative spreadsheet</a>&nbsp;and pick out a few that seem to meet my initial requirements and then do a bit more digging into those.</p>
