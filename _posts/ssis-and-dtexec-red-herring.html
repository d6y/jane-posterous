When initially deploying my SSIS package to my pre-production environment I got a bit hooked up on the following warning message which was appearing despite calling my package via <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms162810.aspx">DTExec</a> with <span class="code">/conf = C:\Configuration.dtsConfig</span><p /><span class="code"><br />Warning: 2006-08-21 10:58:19.96<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Code: 0x80012014<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Source: export process<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Description: The configuration file "D:\Configuration.dtsConfig" cannot be found. Check the directory and file name.<br />End Warning<br />Warning: 2006-08-21 10:58:19.96<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Code: 0x80012059<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Source: export process<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Description: Failed to load at least one of the configuration entries for the package. Check configurations entries and previous warnings to see descriptions of which configuration failed.<br />End Warning</span><p />I managed to reproduce this on my development machine by renaming D:\Configuration.dtsConfig to .dtsConfigx and running the package.  It seems that SSIS checks for the configuration in the location it was originally created before processing the /conf override.  Once I'd sorted this out I could concentrate on the real errors :-)<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-115685787352680115?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
