So, after spending an hour trying to sort this out, here's the steps that worked for me:<br /><ul><li>Ensure you have Adobe Digital Edition installed</li><li>Disconnect your <a href="http://www.coolreaders.com/swf/360-cooler.asp">Cool-er eBook reader</a> - it doesn't need to be attached at this point</li><li>Buy eBook in ePub format from Waterstones (actually don't cos the process sucks, but if you have already...)</li><li>Click Download</li><li>File downloaded will be something like URLLink.acsm</li><li>Click on this file, the eBook should then open in Adobe Digital Edition (you may need to authorise Adobe Digital Edition)</li><li>Go and get a beer, you've done well</li><li>Quit Adobe Digital Edition</li><li>Connect your Cool-er eBook reader</li><li>Open Adobe Digital Edition</li><li>Your Cool-er eBook reader should be displayed in your Library - mine appears as NTX_EB600</li><li>Select your eBook and drag it onto the eBook reader</li><li>Disconnect the Cool-er eBook reader (which in itself is a challenge on the Mac as it remounts itself constantly)</li><li>Look on your Cool-er eBook reader - your newly purchased eBook should be on your Cool-er device in the Digital Editions folder</li><li>Go and get another beer and enjoy your book</li></ul><p />This really shouldn't need a blog post of instructions, it should just work, but it didn't, and that's hugely disappointing.  I want eBook readers to work - this is my first purchase (I've only read free eBooks up until now), and I wanted it to be smooth and lovely, but it wasn't and it cost more than I could get it via Amazon in print. *sigh*<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-1884395386577684913?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
