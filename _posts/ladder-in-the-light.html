This underpass links Regency Square with the seafront, and always seems to have one light or another which isn't working.  This morning there was a step ladder, but nothing else.  I loved the effect of the lighting on the scene.<p />It was taken on a 1st generaton iPhone through the <a href="http://www.sudobility.com/Night%20Camera.html">NightCamera</a> app, and then processed using the Noir filter in <a href="http://www.themill.com/colourapp/">Mill Colour</a> before having a border added in <a href="http://mobile.photoshop.com/iphone/">Photoshop mobile</a><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-1801881395208852068?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
