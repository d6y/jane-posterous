    <p>I know this did the rounds yesterday, but I got around to reading the article earlier rather than just looking at the photographs, and I thought it was amazing. Not only are the paper creations beautiful, and delightful, but the idea of them being left and found resulting in them being treasured in libraries and museums is wonderful. Great work whoever you are.</p></div>
