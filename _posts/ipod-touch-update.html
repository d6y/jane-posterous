One of the applications I'm really missing is an interface to <a href="http://www.last.fm/">Last fm</a> so I'm hoping that when the developer kit gets released, an authorised application will be written.<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-3566976536054349509?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
