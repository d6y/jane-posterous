    <p>In March I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/archives/date-posted/2010/03/calendar/">uploaded 236 photos</a></p><p>This photo was taken using <a href="http://hipstamaticapp.com/">hipstamatic</a> with the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/johnslens/">John S lens</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/blankofilm/">Blanko film</a> (which is fast becoming my favourite combination).</p><p>It was taken at Saltdean, just along the coast from Brighton, whilst we were out taking the dog for a walk.  Richard and Skitters just happened to walk to the end of the walkway and stop just as I got the iPhone out.  I took a similar photo, only posed with them both looking at me, on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157623346789135/">my Olympus AM-100</a> film camera loaded with Kodak Professional BW400CN but as the film isn't finished yet, I haven't got anything to show for it yet.</p><p>I still have a backlog of photos (614 according to Lightroom) to process from my <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/kit-bag-nikon-d80">d80</a>, mainly from our 3 week holiday in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/tags/hongkong">Hong Kong</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/tags/sydney">Sydney</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/tags/tokyo">Tokyo</a>.  I hope to finish these off during April.</p></div>
