The photo has had no post processing. The film was processed and scanned by <a href="http://www.colourstream.net/">Colourstream</a> in Brighton.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-4926198069718911279?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
