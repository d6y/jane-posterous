<p>It has been about 10 months since I bought and <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/tag/review">reviewed</a> my <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/braun-pixelbank-first-impressions">Braun PixelBank</a> and overall I still find it useful and handy.  <p /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<p />A couple of months ago I had quite a backlog of photos to clear, and as my habit is not to clear down a card until after I've processed and backed up the images I had run out of media.  I decided to buy a nice, shiny new 4GB SD HD card and headed off on my holiday armed with that, some other cards and my Pixelmate.  After taking a days worth of photos I turned it on, plugged in my card and pressed the play button... and nothing happened... usually it starts copying the files and I get to watch the percentage increase (slowly!).  But this time it didn't recognise the card at all.  I haven't really got a way of double checking that it is a HD problem rather than that specific card, but that is my assumption as all the other non SD cards work ok, and the HD card works fine in the camera.</p>
