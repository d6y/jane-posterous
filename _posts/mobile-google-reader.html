Since getting my Nokia 6110 Navigator, I've subscribed to <a href="http://online.vodafone.co.uk/dispatch/Portal/appmanager/vodafone/wrp;wrpsessionid=vY5mHTmLq8rvnPmlHrRJLZ88JttQgNrnh1DVHdVBVC1LX5zdprKh!1659213360?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=templateBlank&amp;pageID=MI_0001&amp;redirectedByRedirectsImplServletFlag=true">vodafone's internet package</a>.  I use <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/">Google Reader</a> as my rss reader, and am making use of the <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/m/view/">mobile version</a> to keep on top of my feeds.  This has changed the way I use google reader.  <p />When I'm using a desktop or laptop I'll skim read an item, and open any interesting links in another tab and go and take a look at the linked content.  I then get caught in a link opening hell and don't get through many of my original RSS items.<p />On the mobile I've found myself using the starring functionality to indicate that there is a link I'd like to follow later.  This means that when I do get some time on a desktop/laptop I've got a subset of items to follow up on allowing me to concentrate on them rather than skimming through.  I've also noticed that I am reading many of the items more thoroughly, probably because there is less "link opening" going on and so less distraction.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-3429358711933060902?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
