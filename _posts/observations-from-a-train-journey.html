<p>A couple of notes I made in October when on a train from Brighton to London St Pancras:</p>
<p>Of the 8 people on my table and the one next to me, I see:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 x physical paper copies of the Guardian</li>
<li>3 x physical paper copies of Metro</li>
<li>2 x kindle (mine with guardian downloaded)</li>
<li>1 x mobile phone browser</li>
</ul>
<p>So, overall paper wins, but mainly being raised up by the distribution of free papers.</p>
</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>
<p>If smart phones are smart, why did a guy have to hang up his call to be able to check his calendar to see if he can fit in an appointment. And then say he'd reply by email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is nonsense.</p>
<p>And I do it too. I open up my calendar on a browser or laptop because trying to have a phone conversation and check a detail held on my phone is too hard to orchestrate - I know it's possible, but it isn't easy</p>
</p>
