<p>The consultation period started in January when the announcement was made that Glass's were looking to streamline the business and close down the Crowborough office.  The news was made <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/end-of-an-era-or-a-fresh-start">official</a> a month later with an end date of May 18th.  Different people handled the news in different ways, but everyone started looking for jobs and opportunities - the first of my team left on Friday, to start his new role at <a href="http://www.ballardchalmers.com/">Ballard Chalmers</a>.  <p />I started networking more, but otherwise didn't do much other than set up job alerts at <a href="http://www.wiredsussex.com/jobs/JobSearch.asp">wired sussex</a>, <a href="http://www.jobserve.com/">jobserve</a> and the <a href="http://www.theitjobboard.com/">it job board</a> (although to be honest the quantity of jobs coming through from jobserve was so overwhelming that I deleted the email more often than I read it).  Friends and colleagues sent through some job adverts they thought were appropriate to me, and I made use of the fortunate position that our <a href="http://kw-agiledevelopment.blogspot.com/">ex-CTO</a> now works at <a href="http://www.reedinfo.co.uk/rb2_home/rb2_home.htm">RBI</a> and sent my CV through to him too.  The "friends, colleages and ex-CTO" approach got me 2 interviews, one in East Grinstead, one in Brighton - neither feeling like the right job for this time, although they were both great opportunities.  I started to list what I wanted from a new job, and felt that the most important things for me were (in no particular order): walk to work, or get bus/train to work - need a break from driving, web work - probably an agency so there is variety, busy - a job where things get delivered and I get a feeling of achievement.<p />On Tuesday I got a Wired Sussex alert email and <a href="http://www.wiredsussex.com/Jobs/JobSearchResult.asp?Item=4251">followed the link</a> to discover that <a href="http://www.madgex.com/">Madgex</a> wanted freelance senior developers.  Madgex are a company I have heard good things about, and from what I'd heard, and from reading the website I got the feeling that they met my requirements.  So, I sent off a quick email, attached my CV and waited to hear more.  I didn't have to wait long, and I had a good email conversation with the Chief Technical Officer and we agreed that I should go in and meet them on Thursday for an inteview for a permanent position with them.  I did just this, got on well with him and the other guys I met and went away with a great feeling.<p />My CV lists <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/">this site</a> for all to see, I feel that blogging, and all the information held here is part of who I am.  Madgex are the only company who I've interviewed with this time that took the time to follow the link and read a bit about me - resulting in a conversation about <a href="http://www.brightonbloggers.com/">BrightonBloggers</a> - where the idea came from, how long I've looked after it etc.  The fact that someone had taken the time to do a bit more research in preparation for meeting with me was really pleasing to me.<p />The upshot of all of this is that as of May 21st I will be permanent, full-time, Senior Software Developer for <a href="http://www.madgex.com/">Madgex Limited</a>.  I've signed the contract today (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools'_Day">April Fool's Day</a> - hope that isn't a bad sign!) and am looking forward to moving on and starting to make a contribution.</p>
