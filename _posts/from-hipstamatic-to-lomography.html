<p>A few weeks ago, <a href="http://lomokev.com">Lomokev</a> <a href="http://lomokev.com/blog/hipstamatics-in-london/">posted an article</a> on his blog about the <a href="http://www.hipstamatics.com/">Hipstamatics</a> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=163720836989460">exhibition</a> in London. This intrigued me, so I thought I'd use one of my Wednesday afternoons off to go and take a look. The <a href="http://www.orangedotgallery.co.uk/">Orange Dot Gallery</a>, where the exhibition is hosted, is small, and incredibly easy to walk past if you're not looking for it, it doesn't look like a gallery, being in the middle of a parade of shops. It was quite a lovely space, and I had the space to myself.</p>
<p>I know that there is a lot of love and hate for <a href="http://hipstamaticapp.com/">hipstamatic</a> around photographers on the internet. Some people love it for its quirky effects. Others hate it for the uniformity of those effects. I go through phases as I do with most of my photography. Still, what better way to record my afternoon than via the medium of hipstamatic.</p>
<p><strong>Chairs and hipstamatic prints</strong> - being the only person there, I got to stand back and get up close and really interact with the photographs</p>

<p><strong>Hipstamatics hung</strong> - I loved the simple display method<br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/5397777686/" title="Hipstamatics by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5257/5397777686_b2106f18d9.jpg" height="500" alt="Hipstamatics" width="500" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Hipstamatic of a hipstamatic</strong> - this was my favourite photograph (taken by <a href="http://streetographer.com">Gary Cohen</a>)<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/5397776842/" title="Hipstamatic of a hipstamatic by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5131/5397776842_479a4fbb2f.jpg" height="500" alt="Hipstamatic of a hipstamatic" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>After leaving the gallery I headed back to Carnaby Street (via the stairs at Russell Square)</p>

<p>and to the <a href="http://microsites.lomography.com/stores/gallery-stores/london">Lomography Gallery Store</a>&nbsp;for a browse (I managed to only leave with a book, and not an arm full of photographic equipment)</p>

<p>So from low-fi iPhone to low-fi film in a matter of hours</p>
