<p>Simple steps to be more productive. After looking again at the "Eat that frog" process the other day I've added a daily prioritisation step to my method. This idea of a Top 5 fits in to that well giving a starting point of how many higher priority items are on my list.  Another thing I really need to get better at is focussing or stopping trying to multitask so much - a year or so ago I used to turn off email, close down my chat client and focus.  When writing documents, I still reduce distraction using tools like <a href="http://www.ommwriter.com/">ommwriter</a> or <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom">writeroom</a> and this has worked well for producing some of the NVQ evidence.  When coding I find it much harder as I almost always have to have a browser open to test what I'm working on and it is then I am just one small step from distraction.  Anyone got any tips?</p>
