Copy-writing isn't something that makes up any element of my job, but is something that I felt was worth knowing about, for this blog, and for who knows what exciting future projects might come my way.<p />Relly produced some great takeaway material for us, which contains examples of different styles of writing, and includes a Webiblography of useful material.  It mentions a few articles from <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/">copyblogger</a> - the <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/copywriting-101/">Copywriting 101:An Introduction to Copywriting</a> one caught my eye.  My key learning from Relly's talk was to be authentic in my writing, so to write like I'd talk I guess, without using vocabulary I wouldn't normally use.<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-2775235005049988806?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
