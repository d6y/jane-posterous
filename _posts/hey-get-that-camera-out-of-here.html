On Wednesday evening I attended a panel discussion organised by the <a href="http://bhcc-online.org/index.php">Brighton and Hove Camera club</a> entitled "Hey! Get that camera out of here! Photojournalism, propaganda, privacy and public interest: a panel discussion".  The panel were: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/lomokev">Kevin Meredith</a>, <a href="http://gailwardphotography.co.uk/">Gail Ward</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc-law.co.uk/commercial-law-jonathan-friend.php">Jonathan Friend</a>, <a href="http://johnperivolaris.com/">John Pervolaris</a>, <a href="http://brixtonstreetstudio.net/">Alison Locke</a> and <a href="http://www.rps.org/Fenton-House/Graham-Sergeant-FRPS">Graham Sergeant</a>.<p />The discussion started with an introduction to the evening, and to <a href="http://www.landmineaction.org/">Landmine Action</a>, the charity which the proceeds from the evening went to.  Then followed a 5 minute introduction by each of the panel members.  There were some print-outs at the back of the room of various recent stories, firstly of a series of comments to the article <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/08/17/sv_photographers.xml&amp;page=2">Has our increasingly paranoid society declared war on the humble 'weekend snapper'?</a> and also <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/7651107.stm">Man fined for taking photograph</a> which proved a good starting point to get the discussion off and running.  The discussion covered street photography, whether to get a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_release">model release</a> form signed (some of the panel did, some didn't), how to handle people stopping you when you've got your camera - suggestions included not being confrontational, turning it around and asking why they're stopping you, showing them the <a href="http://www.sirimo.co.uk/ukpr.php">UK photographers rights</a> pdf and taking them through it etc<p />One of the members of the panel, Jonathan Friend, is a solicitor so he had some great facts about the law - about copyright, ownership and when it is/is not legal to take photographs etc.  For instance, Trafalgar Square is private property and so photographic restrictions are legal.  There are also some laws about the right to stop on a pavement - you can walk, but you can't stop.  Kevin mentioned the image search engine <a href="http://tineye.com">tineye</a> which when you upload an image, will search the web for that image and let you know where this image has been used - which sounds rather handy.  <p />All in all a good and enjoyable evening and I left feeling a bit more informed than when I'd arrived.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-9013966655840173388?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
