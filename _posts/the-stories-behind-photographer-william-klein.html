<p>This short film, found in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Contacts-Vol-Great-Tradition-Photojournalism/dp/B000AYEL88">Contacts, Volume 1</a>, is a fascinating video in which photographer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Klein">William Klein</a> takes us beyond his iconic images to discuss the stories revealed in his contact sheets. </p>
<blockquote><p>The picture is taken at 1/125 of a second. What do you know of a photographer’s work? A hundred pictures? Let’s say 125. That comes out to one second. Let’s say, more like 250 photographs? That would be a rather large body of work. And that would come out to two seconds. The life of a photographer — even of a great photographer, as they say — two seconds.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s always awesome listening to well-known photographers talk about their work.</p>
