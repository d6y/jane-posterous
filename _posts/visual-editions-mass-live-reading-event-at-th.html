      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">We took our third book, <a href="http://www.visual-editions.com/our-books/composition-no-1">Composition No. 1</a>, in all its 150 loose and self-contained pages glory and married that up with 150 brilliantly keen Reader Outlouders. The idea was simple: each Reader Outlouder read out a different page from the book. And each Reader Outlouder was asked to read from a different spot in the museum (galleries, stairs, corridors, even the National Art Library). And the thousands of Friday Late visitors were given the chance to have the full book read out loud to them in whichever order they fancied.</blockquote>

    <p>Something about this sounds wonderful. I like the idea that you could mooch around the museum, stop to listen to a self-contained page being read, then move on to look at some exhibits before stopping to listen to another page being read.</p></div>
