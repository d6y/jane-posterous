<h1>The Camera</h1><br />My main camera at the moment is a <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/CanonG3.xml">Canon G3</a>.  I've had it for 4 years now, and I still love it.  We have produced some really pleasing images <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/tags/g3/">between us</a>.  I've bought a lot of additions for it over the years, including a spare battery (although to be fair the G3 battery has always been excellent).<br /><h1>The Accessories</h1><br />I have 2 <a href="http://www.lensmateonline.com/newsite/G5G3.html">52mm lensmate lens adapters</a>.  I have a 52mm lenscap and a set of different filters.  <p />The filters I have are:<ul><li>a 52mm Circular Polariser</li><li>a 52mm 1A filter</li><li>a 52mm diffuser</li><li>a ND4 Neutral Density filter</li><li>a 52mm cross filter</li><li>a set of close up filters (+4, +2, +1)</li></ul><p />I have 2 additional lenses:<ul><li>a Kenko 2.0x Teleconverter (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00017LU9W/ref=nosim/?tag=dealtime-photo-20&amp;creative=380333&amp;creativeASIN=B00017LU9W&amp;linkCode=asn">KNT-20</a>)</li><li>a Raynox 0.72x Wide Angle lens (<a href="http://www.raynox.co.jp/english/dcr/dcr720/dcr720egindex.htm">DCR-720</a>)</li></ul><br /><h1>The Case</h1><br />I store my camera in a <a href="http://www.lowepro.com">LowePro</a> case, which has enough space for the camera, a remote control and a spare card.  I've had the case as long as I've had the camera, and it has lasted very well.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-8446242759664413815?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
