WebDD tomorrow, and I'd read through all the <a href="http://www.webdd.org.uk/Sessions.aspx">sessions</a> at the weekend and planned my <a href="http://www.webdd.org.uk/Schedule.aspx">schedule</a> only to discover that it has been updated, and so my initial plan needs revisiting.  Now I find that <a href="http://www.webdd.org.uk/ViewSession.aspx?SessionID=60">Glenn Jones</a> clashes with <a href="http://www.webdd.org.uk/ViewSession.aspx?SessionID=57">Scott Guthrie</a> :-(  A re-plan is in progress...<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-1514804404566892188?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
