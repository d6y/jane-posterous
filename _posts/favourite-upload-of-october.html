<p>In October <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/archives/date-posted/2009/10/">I uploaded 89 photos to flickr</a>.<p />This photo is of Richard and Skitters on Worms Head Island near Rhossili, in the Gower peninsular in Wales.<p />As with <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/favourite-upload-of-september">last months favourite upload</a> it was taken during our weeklong <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157622433549260/">holiday in Gower, Wales</a>.  (It has taken me quite a long time to work through all the photos I took making that trip eligible for 2 <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/tag/uploadofthemonth.html">uploads of the month</a>).<p />This photo was taken with my <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/kit-bag-nikon-d80">Nikon d80</a>, with my <a href="http://www.bythom.com/18200lens.htm">Nikkor18-200mm f/3.5-5.6G IF DX VR lens</a>.<p />I have chosen this photo for a couple of reasons - firstly it reminds me of a really lovely holiday, and includes Richard and Skitters, and secondly because I like the shape of the cliff and the way the roughness of it contrasts against the flat, calm sea.</p>
