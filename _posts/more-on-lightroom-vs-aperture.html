I've pretty much decided to go with Lightroom, it does most of what I need in the beta, and it sounds like the red eye reduction will be in the final version.  I've also been using the workflow of lightroom without really thinking about it which is a good sign.  Today's task has been to use the <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photos/2007_01_27/">web output facility</a>.  The only thing I've found frustrating is that I can only find the ability to make a contact information link is via the flash gallery, which doesn't seem to allow much in the way of image sizing.<p />I've also found that <a href="http://blog.duncandavidson.com/">Duncan Davidson</a> has been doing some lightroom vs aperture comparisons:<ul><br /><li><a href="http://blog.duncandavidson.com/2006/12/more_lightroom_.html">More Lightroom and Aperture RAW Comparisons</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://blog.duncandavidson.com/2006/12/aperture_vs_lig.html">Aperture vs Lightroom RAW Conversion</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://blog.duncandavidson.com/2006/09/aperture_vs_lig.html">Aperture vs Lightroom</a></li></ul><br />all of which make interesting reading<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-7078176979840256683?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
