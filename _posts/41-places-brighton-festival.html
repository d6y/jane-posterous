 <br /> <span style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 0px;">  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/491229018/">#12 with the author William Shaw</a>  <br />  Originally uploaded by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/janed/">Jane Dallaway</a>. </span></div>I'd noticed a <a href="http://babblebabblebabble.blogs.com/babble_babble_babble/2007/05/love_life_and_l.html">couple</a> of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adactio/489635618/">people</a> with photos of stories in the wild around Brighton (part of the <a href="http://41places.org/">41 Places</a> installation as it turns out).  Yesterday I headed out armed with shiny new camera and <a href="http://41places.org/images/41P_Map.pdf">downloaded map</a> to see how many I could find.  <p />I headed first for number <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/491234593/">13</a>, outside Churchill Square, and found that without difficulty.  It wasn't all I found.  As I stood there taking photos 2 guys wandered up and spoke to me, offering me a leaflet with the map on - I showed them my downloaded version, and took a copy of their slightly more weatherproof version - ink jet printer + rain = splodgy downloaded map :-(<p />As we stood talking I discovered that one of the guys was no other than <a href="http://www.unmadeup.com/">William Shaw</a>, the author.  He mentioned that there was a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/378103@N23/">flickr group</a> for the installation, and in the absence of any other way to remember this I handed him one of my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/408651279/">moo cards</a>.  He recognised my name, and so we chatted a bit more and realised that he is one of my <a href="http://www.brightonbloggers.com/blogs/">Brighton Bloggers</a>.  <p />We moved on, and I headed off to find some more, and discovered that I was following them.  I realised that I'd missed an opportunity and that I should have taken a photo of William with his artwork.  Fortunately they stopped at number 12 to make sure I spotted it, and so I shot this photo.<p />All in all I managed to find 8 of the places yesterday, and I've put together a <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/41places.html">page charting my progress.  I'm hoping to find some more at the weekend.</a>.<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-6985375739628859138?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
