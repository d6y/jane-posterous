<p>About a year ago now, I tweeted</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Looking for a mind mapping application for the iPhone or iPod Touch - any recommendations?</blockquote>
<p>A friend of mine mentioned <a href="http://www.tenero.mobi/products/index.html">iBlueSky</a> and after a look at the website I bought it.  At the time I was planning a couple of <a href="http://www.madgex.com/">Madgex</a> <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/tag/ilp">ILP</a> talks, and wanted to try out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map">mind-mapping</a> as a way of organising my thoughts. <p />One year one and I'm making a lot of use of iBlueSky again as part of my <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/tag/nvq">NVQ</a> work.  So, the time has come to finally review the app for others who may be looking for an iPhone/iPod Touch mind-mapping app.<p /></p>
<h2>How do I use it?</h2>
<p><br />I use iBlueSky mainly for idea capture, I like that I can jot down ideas when I get a spare few minutes.  It doesn't seem to take long for me to lose myself in the problem domain and add new thoughts.  As I mentioned above, I've been making a lot of use of it for my NVQ work, and just the research for Unit D1 has resulted in 3 or 4 mind maps.<p /></p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p><br />The first page you're going to be presented with is a list of projects.  Clicking on any one of these will open the project for editing.  The order can be changed via the Settings application - allowing you to order them manually, by created date or by last modified date (which is what I've chosen to use)<p /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<h2>Getting maps in and out</h2>
<p><br />One of the more recent additions to iBlueSky is the ability to <a href="http://www.tenero.co.uk:8080/Upload/Upload.do#">import mind-maps</a>.  As mentioned on their website, as of version 2.0, released in June</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">iBlueSky now imports and exports in Novamind, OPML and Freemind formats.</blockquote>
<p>Exports are handled via email, and are provided in PNG, PDF, MM (which works with <a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">FreeMind</a>), text, OPML, NMIND and their own BSKY format.  You don't chose a format, when you do email the project, all formats get created and appended to the email.<p /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

</div>
<p />There is also an option to backup all of the projects - this uses <a href="http://box.net/">Box.Net</a>, a website for sharing files, which comes with a limited free version.  All projects are stored in a folder called iBlueSky in the <a href="http://box.net/files">files</a> area.  These projects are stored as BSKY format, which are importable via the import function.<p /></p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p><br />I've found the app to be really conducive to getting ideas into a usable format.  I start off with a node with the name of the idea/project/task, and start from there.  Each branch created off that main node will have a different colour.  The colours can be changed if so required.<p /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
<img alt="Media_httpfarm3static_nmcor" height="480" src="/media/getfile/files.posterous.com/import-wdma/gxrpIgdusaryHtvHrxIhaHdHzejtEplqnebczBgHhiAyIEmgxjttBwprtcpJ/media_httpfarm3static_nmcor.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="320" />
</div>
<p />Branches can be cut or copied and so can be moved around if ideas are found to be more or less related.<p /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
<img alt="Media_httpfarm4static_kmgdg" height="480" src="/media/getfile/files.posterous.com/import-wdma/ceyEhiatlmzxeCkGGqCupjnvyDFJkzjzbpnvrdJjpqwjEAfEBqdsodljCGih/media_httpfarm4static_kmGdG.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="320" />

<p />The orientation of the map changes according to the way that the device is held.  There doesn't seem to be a way to lock the orientation, a feature which would be very useful.  You can zoom in to the map, so you can see the whole map or a part of it as you feel you need.<p /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<h2>How much?</h2>
<p><br />When I bought it a year ago, I paid &pound;4.99.  It is now &pound;1 more at &pound;5.99.  It is one of the most expensive apps I've bought, and I do go through stages when I don't use it.  But, when I do need to do some mind mapping, I find it great.  I tend to use it in conjunction with FreeMind now that these can be imported and so will update sometimes on the iPod Touch, and sometimes at  a computer. <p /></p>
<h2>Anything else?</h2>
<p><br />I recently had the app crash a couple of times, once when emailing, and once when just generally editing.  I mentioned this on twitter, and within an hour had been responded to, given the support email address and was in conversation with <a href="http://tenero.co.uk">Tenero</a> as they tried to resolve my issues - most impressive.<p /></p>
<h2>Would I buy it again?</h2>
<p><br />Yes, I sure would.  The app has evolved (in a good way) over the past year, and has got some great features.  It works well for me and suits what I'm trying to do.<p /></p>
