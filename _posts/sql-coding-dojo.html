<p>Last week I led a SQL based Coding Dojo as part of the <a href="http://madgex.com/">Madgex</a> <a href="http://madgex.com/innovation/">ILP</a> programme.  A lot of ILP sessions are in a presentation format, and I wanted to do something with a bit more, or in fact a lot more, attendee participation.  I've been interested in the idea of deliberate practice for a while, and Richard has been to quite a few coding dojos and so I figured it was time to give it a try.  Shortly after I'd decided to do one, I attended a <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/event-in-the-brain-of-gojko-adzic-testing-web">Skills Matter evening</a> and stumbled across <a href="http://isanchez.net/">Ivan Sanchez</a>, who blogged about <a href="http://isanchez.net/2008/08/31/starting-a-coding-dojo/">Starting a Coding dojo</a> which helped me get my thoughts in hand.<p />I chose to use SQL as the area to practice, mainly because it is an area I am really familiar with and so could help out if necessary.  Also I have a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Puzzles-Answers-Kaufmann-Management-Systems/dp/1558604537">Joe Celko's SQL Puzzles and Answers</a> which provided me with a great collection of puzzles to practice with.<p />I chose a puzzle called Double Duty which is described as follows:</p>
<blockquote>A person may have more than one role. The roles are defined as follows:<br />O &ndash; Officer<br />D &ndash; Director<p />The PersonRole table is defined as:<br /><span class="code">PersonName VARCHAR(50)<br />RoleCode CHAR(1)</span><p />Produce a list of People and their roles where they are either Officer or Director, and where anyone with both the O and D role is represented once as B &ndash; Both.</blockquote>
<p><br />I've put a copy of the SQL file I produced to create the tables, and populate the data <a href="http://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B_AkC4ZdTI9tZWZkZTlhODUtZjE0Ny00NTQ5LWIzZmQtMDU1YWJkMmVlOTk0&amp;hl=en_GB">here</a>, so feel free to <a href="http://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B_AkC4ZdTI9tZWZkZTlhODUtZjE0Ny00NTQ5LWIzZmQtMDU1YWJkMmVlOTk0&amp;hl=en_GB">take a look</a>.<p />I opened the session by explaining what a dojo was (a training hall for practice in the martial arts), what a coding dojo was (a practice area for coding skills) and introduced the problem domain (I provided print outs of the table structure, data and expected results).  I then introduced the roles we were going to use - driver and co-pilot - and the rules we were going to adhere to.  In our main meeting room we have a large plasma screen and so I connected this to my laptop so that the audience could see exactly the same as the driver and co-pilot.  I provided a couple of SQL books and a <a href="http://www.addedbytes.com/cheat-sheets/sql-server-cheat-sheet/">SQL Server cheatsheet</a> for reference.<p />After the initial self-consciousness had gone, the pairs settled into the idea pretty well, and it was interesting to watch the different pairs interact and form new (rapid) working relationships.  There were 7 participants, and each spent 5 minutes as the driver and 5 minutes as the co-pilot.  By the end of the session there were 4 solutions produced which meant that the group as a whole felt that they'd achieved something.  We ran a quick retrospective at the end of the session and the following were the major points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The audience found a certain amount of frustration by not being able to help, and not being able to shout out suggestions.</li>
<li>At least one person acting as the co-pilot found it hard to articulate what needed to be done.</li>
<li>At least one person admitted to finding it hard to think without having their fingers on the keyboard.</li>
<li>At least one person learnt something about SQL.</li>
<li>Quite a few people found a laptop keyboard hard to use, so a proper keyboard would have helped.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />As a result of the success of this one, I've booked in another one for a couple of months time - again SQL based but I'm also thinking of making use of <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/tddproblems/">TDD Problems</a> for another practicable skill.</p>
