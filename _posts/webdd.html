<p>I've registered to attend the <a href="http://www.webdd.org.uk/Default.aspx">WebDD</a> event at Reading on February 3rd.  Some of the <a href="http://www.webdd.org.uk/Sessions.aspx">sessions</a> look really interesting.  <p />I'm definitely planning to attend the "Ruby On Rails for .NET Developers" talk by <a href="http://shinydevelopment.com/">Dave Verwer</a> as Ruby is something I've been trying to find time to look at for a while now.  I narrowly missed attending the <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/129897/">Brighton Ruby user group meeting on Tuesday</a>, but maybe by the next one I'll have learnt a bit more about it.  <p />I'm also likely to pop along to the two sessions on "End to End Web Sites" by <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/">Scott Guthrie</a> as they seem like a good comprehensive way to keep the content learnt at my <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/ms2543-core-web-application-technologies-cour-0">recent courses</a> fresh, especially the AJAX bits.</p>
