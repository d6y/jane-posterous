<p>I got a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002LVUWFE/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=janedall-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B002LVUWFE">Kindle</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=janedall-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B002LVUWFE" border="0" height="1" alt="" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" /> for Christmas, and I love it.</p>
<p>I love that is a single purpose device. &nbsp;As I managed to brick my iPhone the other day, so it wouldn't turn on, that meant that this multi use device, which is also a phone, wasn't even a phone. That's a bit limiting!</p>
<p>Things I love about my kindle are:</p>
<ul>
<li>ease of getting books onto it via WhisperNet</li>
<li>ease of getting additional files onto it via the @kindle.com email addresses (paid for or free via the free.kindle.com address)</li>
<li>my case - the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B003DZ167K/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=janedall-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B003DZ167K">green leather case</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=janedall-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B003DZ167K" border="0" height="1" alt="" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" /> makes it a delight to hold and interact with</li>
<li>ability to highlight text in a book, and get at it later to include in a summary</li>
<li>ability to annotate text, and again to later get at it for summarisation etc</li>
<li>the screen works well in many different light conditions - outside, inside, lit naturally, artificial lit</li>
<li>it doesn't go beep or distract me in any way, meaning that I can get involved in whatever I'm reading</li>
</ul>
<p>Things I've learnt are:</p>
<ul>
<li>turn off the wireless access if you don't need it, this saves a lot of battery power</li>
<li>there's a minesweeper game on it</li>
<li>you can take a screen shot</li>
</ul>
<p>My kindle goes most places with me. It goes to work with me every day, and for the first time in years I can often be found reading a bit of my novel during my lunch break. During the two weeks whilst I was in Hull, dealing with my Dad's death, the ability to get at new books easily and quickly was wonderful. I could stop myself from getting too upset by losing myself in an engaging bit of fiction, not necessarily a book I'd have bought in other circumstances, but that was really suited to my situations. And it was only a couple of clicks away.</p>
