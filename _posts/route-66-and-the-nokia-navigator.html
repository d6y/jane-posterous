This morning I made my first purchase of a map from Route 66 for my Nokia Navigator.  After an unsuccessful attempt using VMWare on the Mac, I took the DVD to work and tried it there.  <p /><span style="font-weight: bold;">First step - installation</span>.  No problems, just followed the instructions on the screen - although the phone does have to be attached to the PC.<p /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Second step - choosing a map</span>.  One discovery I made, the hard way (by buying the wrong map), is that for France I can buy either the whole of France for EUR49.95, or sub-areas for EUR9.95.  These sub-areas are nothing more than cities, they aren't provinces or regions, so for my trip I ended up needing the whole of France.  <p /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Third step - buying a map</span>.  At the top left hand corner is a button marked Switch to Route 66 Store.  I recommend doing this rather than using the DVD.  <br /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<br />Select the appropriate map from the left hand side (don't forget to check out the Free travel guides at the top of the menu as well)<br /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<br />When you select a map, the view will alter to something similar to below<br /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

</div>
<br />Pressing the Add to cart button moves the map into the Shopping cart in the right hand side of the screen.  <br />Pressing the checkout button allows you to enter your personal details and a credit card and when payment is successful the Download screen should be displayed.  This will firstly download the map to the PC, and then to the phone.<br />Closing the screen will not activate the map on your phone at this point but will display a message similar to the following:<br /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

</div>
<p /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fourth Step - Activating the map</span>.  Close down Route 66 Sync and disconnect the phone.  Reconnect the phone and start up Route 66 sync again.  On my PC a bubble was displayed informing me of new content.  I clicked on the bubble and allowed the content to be updated.  This seemed to activate the maps for me.<p />I didn't find the process particularly easy.  These notes are as much for me as for anyone else, with the hope that next time I need to buy a map I can do it far easier than the 4 hours it took today trying out different things.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-6208085604232318958?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
