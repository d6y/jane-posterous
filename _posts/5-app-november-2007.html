It was really useful to hear the history behind the project - how it came about, and also where he hopes it will go.<p />After a quick break, with chance to eat more of the lovely ginger cake, it was on with the pitches.  <p />The first was Ian doing a reverse pitch - he wants a skills board - so when he needs to find a designer, or a python developer he knows exactly where to go.<p />The second was Ben and Danny talking about <a href="http://blog.artmeddler.com/">artmeddler</a> (a working title) which sounded like quite a cool concept - basically a web site enabling an artist to upload their artwork in several different formats - so from the sketch, through to the finished work.  The original aim is to enable feedback on when a piece of artwork is finished, so preventing the artist from over working it.<p />Then onto a few quick plugs - one from Vicky mentioning the jobs we've got going at <a href="http://www.madgex.com/">Madgex</a>, one from Danny for the Geek Wine Thing and the last for the Open Coffee at the University on Thursday (and then regularly afterwards)<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-6828882380245486761?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
