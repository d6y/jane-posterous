 <br /> <span style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 0px;">  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/503199214/">Women in Engineering</a>  <br />  Originally uploaded by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/janed/">Jane Dallaway</a>. </span></div>Last night, <a href="http://www.rosiesherry.com/">Rosie</a> and I headed off to Google to attend the <a href="http://www.womenintechnology.co.uk/resources/women_in_engineering_invite.pdf">London Women in Engineering Tech Talk</a>.  I've never been to the Google offices before, although <a href="http://blog.spiralarm.com/richard/archive/2006_09_01_archive.html">Richard has</a>, and I must admit that this was part of the appeal.  Additionally, I'm on holiday at the moment and so knew that the 6pm start wasn't going to be a problem.<p />The talk was "<a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/%7Escd/esop06.pdf">The benefits of putting objects into boxes, using pencil and paper</a>" by <a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~scd/">Dr Sophia Drossopoulou</a> and was quite technical in places, needing me to pull out some long discarded set theory from the recesses of my mind.  All very interesting though.<p />Both during the drinks reception, and the meal it became apparent to both Rosie and I that a different crowd of people attended this event than attend either the <a href="http://www.brightongirlgeekdinners.co.uk/">Brighton Girl Geek Dinners</a> or the <a href="http://sussex.geekdinner.co.uk/">Sussex Geek Dinners</a>.  Firstly, being in Brighton, it is very easy to forget about the world of computing outside of the web, we are so web focussed down here.  Secondly, a lot of the people I spoke to were academics, either studying for a PhD or having recently completed one.  This made for some interesting conversations, finding out about research into various different (non-web) areas.<p />I visited the toilets and was amused by the "<a href="http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2007/01/introducing-testing-on-toilet.html">Testing in the toilets</a>" newsletter that was on the door.  Rosie pointed out that the content had been made into a <a href="http://googletesting.blogspot.com/">public blog</a> with a link to the pdfs to allow you to <a href="http://code.google.com/testing/TotT-2007-04-25.pdf">download and display the latest post</a>.  Seems like a novel idea to me.<p />On leaving we were given a bag of girlie goodies, and sitting on the train Rosie and I pooled our goodies with huge smiles on our faces.<p /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<p />Note: I asked about taking photographs, and was told that I could only take photos in the presentation room, so that is why my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157600227914024/">flickr set</a> doesn't have any photos of food, the canteen or any of the artwork.  The Automation Testing Conference in September didn't have the same restrictions, so the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/googleltc/">flickr group for that</a> has some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adewale_oshineye/238229048/in/pool-googleltc/">google office pictures</a>.<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-6822027308411241036?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
