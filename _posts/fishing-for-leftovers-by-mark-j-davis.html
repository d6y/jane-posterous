<p>I was reading about the <a>2010 Photocrati Fund competition</a> and this photo was featured amongst the selection of images they'd posted to show why <a href="http://www.mark-j-davis.com/">Mark J Davis</a> had won for his <a href="http://markjdavis.photoshelter.com/gallery/Fishing-for-Leftovers/G0000o3QAsTlsjMo/">Fishing for Leftovers</a> project.  This photograph stopped me in my tracks.  The colours, the atmosphere, the focus are all astounding and make this photograph, at least for me, incredible.</p>
