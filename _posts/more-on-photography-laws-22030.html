I was browsing through <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">flickr</a> and spotted another <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/happyaslarry/2420960125/">example of poor treatment of photographers</a>.  Amongst the comments, not only was there a link to the <a href="http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/photographylaw/">Petition to clarify the laws surrounding photography in public places</a> but also there was a link to an Early Day Motion entitled <a href="http://edmi.parliament.uk/EDMi/EDMDetails.aspx?EDMID=35375&amp;SESSION=891">Photography in Public Areas</a>.  As suggested by the commenter I have written to <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/david_lepper/brighton,_pavilion">my MP</a> via <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/">TheyWorkForYou</a> to request his support in this matter (although having since looked at the <a href="http://edmi.parliament.uk/EDMi/EDMByMember.aspx?MID=1469">Early Day Motions he has signed</a>, he already has).<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-1314217531010680578?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
