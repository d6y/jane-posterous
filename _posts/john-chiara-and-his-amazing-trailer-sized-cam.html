    <p>A camera the size of a caravan, pulled along by a car, and parked for a while whilst the photographic process happens.  <br />A developing process that involves an 18-inch diameter sewage pipe.<br />This is really large format photography.</p><p>And something for me to think about, next time I whinge that my d80 is heavy, or bulky, or whatever other excuse springs to mind to explain why I'm leaving it at home today</p></div>
