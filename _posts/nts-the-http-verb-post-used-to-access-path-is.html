<p>Another for the <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/tag/nts">Note To Self</a> list<p />A lot of our sites use a url mapper, so when setting up the sites within IIS we map extension .* to the appropriate aspnet_isapi.dll.  <p />I'd got carried away when setting up the webservice and did the same thing, resulting in a <span class="code">The HTTP verb POST used to access path '/WebService/WebService.asmx/DoSomething' is not allowed.</span> error.  Removing the .* mapping fixes this.</p>
