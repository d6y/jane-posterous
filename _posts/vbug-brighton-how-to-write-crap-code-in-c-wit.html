<br />Last Thursday evening I helped at another VBUG Brighton meeting, this time with <a href="http://www.benlamb.com/">Ben Lamb</a> presenting.  The evening was, as usual, split into two halves with <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/janed/3038364631/in/set-72157609277683994/">pizza</a> and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/janed/3038362173/in/set-72157609277683994/">beer</a> at half time.  This time, more unusually, we had different subjects from the same speaker for both halves.<br /><h2>Part 1 - How to write crap code in C# - Anti-Patterns for Performance </h2><br /><p>The annotated slides are available at <a href="http://www.benlamb.com/">Ben's website</a> as a <a href="http://www.benlamb.com/downloads/talks/CrapCode.pdf">PDF</a></p><p>Ben's talk was all about performance and things to think about it to affect it.&nbsp; One of his key phrases was&nbsp;"Don't try this at home" as he deliberately throttled various bits of his demo application - a windows application to analyse the complete works of Shakespeare to find out what the most used words are (the most used word is Should should you be interested)</p><p>One of the&nbsp;key points&nbsp;I took away&nbsp;is the need to start with some expectations - what sort of performance time is acceptable?&nbsp; Without this it is impossilble to work out whether you're succeeding or not.</p><br /><h2>Part 2 - "Things I heard at PDC"</h2><br /><p>Ben was at <a href="http://www.microsoftpdc.com/">PDC</a> in October and so presented us the things he'd heard about that he thought we might be interested in.&nbsp; A quick look at the website shows me that there are <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/">videos of some of the sessions</a> which may prove useful.</p><p>This was a really useful session, providing a great overview of some of the blog posts, and twitter comments I read whilst the conference was going on.</p><p>So, in summary, another great VBUG Brighton evening, with a good number of people.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-4032719144422727173?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
