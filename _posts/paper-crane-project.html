A few months ago there was a mention on the <a href="http://blog.flickr.com/en">flickr blog</a> <a href="http://blog.flickr.com/en/2007/04/14/the-paper-crane-project/">about</a> the <a href="http://thepapercraneproject.my-expressions.com/">Paper Crane Project</a>.  <p />The project was for <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/eshu/">Liz</a> to make 1000 paper cranes and distribute them around the world.  All I had to do was email Liz and wait patiently.  My crane arrived a week or so ago, and when the weather improves she'll be going on a photo shoot around Brighton.  I've added this photo to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/thepapercraneproject/">group</a> but it won't be the one that is printed out and posted back to Liz.<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-9034543655399413320?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
