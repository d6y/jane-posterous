<p />The <a href="http://www.geekgirlblogs.com/">Geek Girl Blogs</a> site went live a couple of days ago.  From the homepage: <p /><em>Our aim has been to create a central repository that brings these women&rsquo;s blogs together in one place, to create a wealth of knowledge that covers the amazing strength, agility &amp; force that is Women in IT! We also hope that by sharing our experiences we can encourage &amp; enlighten women thinking of a career in IT.</em><p />The aggregated posts can be read via the site at <a href="http://geekgirlblogs.com/GirlTalk.aspx">Girl Talk</a> or by signing up to the <a href="http://geekgirlblogs.com/GirlTalk/tabid/55/moduleid/384/RSS.aspx ">RSS feed</a>.<p /><a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/">This blog of mine</a> is just one of the blogs being included in the feed after <a href="http://www.soulsolutions.com.au/Blog/tabid/73/Default.aspx">Bronwen</a> contacted me about a month ago.  There is a form on the right hand side of the Girl Talk page which you can fill in to get your blog added too.</p>
