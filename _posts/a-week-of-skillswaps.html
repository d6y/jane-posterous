<p><a href="http://yandleblog.com/">Danny</a> approached me a while ago about doing a photography talk, and so I've got a couple of weeks to prepare.  My plans are to do a Tips for digital photographers session initially, and I'd really like to then move on to a critiquing session where the attendees (and me!) put forward photos to be reviewed by the other attendees.  This is an excellent way to learn, and I'm far from being an expert and want to learn too.</p>
