Last night was a busy night in Brighton, with an overlap between <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/236784/">Flash Brighton - Jeremy Keith - Ajax : Flash Killer</a> and <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/219001/">£5 App Meet</a>.  <p /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<p />Richard and I managed to see some of <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/">Jeremy</a>'s presentation (which was excellent) before heading off to the £5 app to hear <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/">Tom Hume</a> talk about the history of <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/fp/">Future Platforms</a>.<p />Jeremy presented on Ajax and how it relates to Flash, and effectively how there is space for both of them - Ajax is good for pages, flash is good for applications.  We were shown a set of different sites and asked "Are they Ajax or not?" - Jeremy pointed to the ratings section on Amazon as a great Ajax example - small, discreet and works really well.  Then we had to grab a cab and move on - any chance of seeing the rest of the slides sometime Jeremy?<p /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<p />Tom gave an excellent presentation about "The gritty reality of founding a software company", discussing the history of FP, the highs and lows, the lessons learnt - check for mobile coverage before renting an office when you're a mobile application provider - and of course the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/1129362508/">Pith</a>!<p />Two excellent events, with excellent local speakers.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-4529034179456136361?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
