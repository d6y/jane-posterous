I've just bought a <a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/template.php?cat=1&amp;grp=4&amp;productNr=4801">Nikon Speedlight SB-800</a> flash unit for my Nikon D80.  I found it at <a href="http://www.ukdigitalcameras.co.uk/">UK Digital Cameras</a> and was really impressed with their service - rapid delivery, a phone call to let me know it was on its way.  I've put batteries on it, attached it to the camera and taken some test shots but I'm still rather intimidated by the fact that it comes with a 125 page manual.  Hopefully I'll find time to read, review and try it out over the Christmas holidays.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-7596473563765072647?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
