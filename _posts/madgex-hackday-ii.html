 <br /> <span style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 0px;">  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/1105866971/">Hackday in progress</a>  <br />  Originally uploaded by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/janed/">Jane Dallaway</a> </span></div>Last week saw the 2nd <a href="http://www.madgex.com/">Madgex</a> hackday.  There were 6 teams, with 24 hours each, to work on a project of our own choosing.  We were the biggest team of 5 people on the day  and focussed on implementing a templating language for ASP.NET based around the concept of <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/templates/">django's templates</a>.  Our hacking went well and by the end of the day we had a working subset of tags.  <p />On Friday we all had to present our projects, and quite a wide range had been done from social policy research, a project documentation creator, a tool for deployments, a tool for managing the status of changes waiting to be deployed, and finally a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157601078370119/">table football</a> webcam (so that the people on the other floors can check that the table is empty before appearing for a game).  Our project won, and so we have custody of the cup until the next hackday.<p />All in all it was an excellent opportunity to work with different people and to investigate some new ideas.
