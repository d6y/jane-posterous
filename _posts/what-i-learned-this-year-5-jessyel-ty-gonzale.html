<p>Getting Paid for Photography Changes Everything<br /> Everyone has a camera. Photography is fun. So when people learn that they can possibly be PAID to do this fun thing, their eyes open up like a fat kid in a cake shop. It looks like such a glamorous job, after all...</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s what I learned: it&rsquo;s only fun and glamorous if you LOVE photography. And yes, we all &ldquo;love&rdquo; photography, but this is the kind of love that country singers talk about &ndash; the kind that hurts.</p>
<p>Photography as a hobby is much different than photography as a profession. If you don&rsquo;t have this love or mindset, sulfur will rain from the sky, and you&rsquo;ll quickly realize it&rsquo;s not glamorous, doesn&rsquo;t pay much, is very stressful, difficult, overly competitive, and you&rsquo;ll hate every second of it.</p>

<div>A good reminder why I've pursued photography as a hobby and not as a profession - I enjoy it, I use it as a form of relaxation. Being directed and pressured isn't what I want from it at the moment.&nbsp;</div>
