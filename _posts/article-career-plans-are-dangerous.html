<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>Instead of formulating the logically perfect ending job and the optimal path to get there, begin with a direction, based on a real desire, and complement that with a strategy to discover and create opportunities consistent with that desire.<p />  In an uncertain world you can&rsquo;t even come close to saying what a specific job might be, but you can say what&rsquo;s valuable and important to you. Who are you? What matters to you? Is it working in a specific industry? Managing people or not? The answers will point you in productive directions.</p>

<div>I've never been very good at having a career plan, having just taken interesting opportunities as they arose. I've often been challenged on this by managers and ambitious colleagues. This article feels like it's finally validating my approach.</div>
