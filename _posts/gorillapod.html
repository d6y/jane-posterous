I was bought a <a href="http://www.joby.com/gp1.html">Gorillapod</a> at Christmas and have used it on quite a few occasions.  Tonight I was listening to a <a href="http://digiphoto.thepodcastnetwork.com/2007/04/02/the-digital-photography-show-45-nikon-on-the-d40x-and-tons-of-free-stuff/">The Digital Photography Show</a> podcast and was pleased to hear an interview with Joby from the <a href="http://www.pmai.org/index.cfm/ci_id/1198/la_id/1.htm">PMA show</a>.<p />The Gorillapod is a really cool little gadget, and I was really pleased to hear that the line has been extended, so there are now 3 different Gorillapods - the <a href="http://www.joby.com/gp1.html">original</a> (which I have), the <a href="http://www.joby.com/gp2.html">Gorillapod SLR</a> and the <a href="http://www.joby.com/gp3.html">Gorillapod SLR-Zoom</a>.  They have also been trialling different colours for the Gorillapods, which sound like great fun.  I'm looking forward to seeing them and I might need to look at getting one of the bigger ones when I get my <a href="http://www.nikon-d80.com/">DSLR</a>.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-720629883024518578?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
