<p><a href="http://twitter.com/d6y">Richard</a> sent me a link to a <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/">The Register</a> article entitled <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/06/23/photography_law/">So, what can you photograph?</a> which relates to the laws surrounding what can, and cannot, be photographed in the UK.<p />Amongst other facts it says:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">As of last week, the government has forbidden couples getting married in registry offices from having their photograph taken as they sign the wedding register.</blockquote>
<p><p />This was news to me (although Richard has just reminded me that he was asked not to video the registry signing at a recent wedding), but a quick google later and an article <a href="http://www.epuk.org/News-snippets/857/govt-bans-wedding-registry-pics">Govt bans wedding registry pics</a> shows up, sourcing <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-565423/Why-Government-killjoys-trying-ban-wedding-day-pictures.html">The Mail</a>, and says</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">New Government guidelines say photographs of couples signing the register could invade the privacy of others because their signatures may be visible on the same page</blockquote>
<p><br />and</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">There are further concerns that details taken from the wedding snaps could be used by fraudsters planning identity theft and that the photos could be in breach of Crown Copyright.</blockquote>
<p><p />The original <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-565423/Why-Government-killjoys-trying-ban-wedding-day-pictures.html">Mail article</a> also says</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">But it seems that the ruling does not affect traditional church weddings. Church of England spokesman Steve Jenkins said: "The focus is always the couple, not the book. It would be obvious if someone started zooming and shooting the book instead.<br />"I'm not aware of anybody being prevented from taking a photo the couple have requested because of data protection at a church wedding."</blockquote>
<p><br />which just seems to complicate the matter.</p>
