<p><a href="http://www.developerday.co.uk/ddd/agendaddd6lineup.asp">DDD6</a> will be held at the Microsoft Campus on the 24th November, and it's full already although apparently they're still <a href="http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032357828&amp;Culture=en-GB">accepting waitlist registrations</a>. <p />This will be my first DeveloperDeveloperDeveloper day, but if <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/webdd-overview">WebDD</a> and <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/sqlbits-conference">SQLBits</a> are anything to go by I'll learn lots and be inspired.</p>
