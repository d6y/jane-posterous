I've recently had the opportunity to use <a href="http://www.altova.com/products/mapforce/data_mapping.html">MapForce</a> to transform one XML document into another.  The drag-and-drop nature of it has worked well, and it saved me brushing up on my extremely rusty XSLT too much.  However, I needed to put some output into CDATA tags.  This had me scratching my head somewhat, and I've ended up resorting to updating the output XSLT to have a <a href="http://www.devguru.com/technologies/xslt/8454.asp">cdata-section-elements</a> section in the <a href="http://www.xm.co.nz/ShoXS/xsloutput.htm">xsl:output</a> tag.  I haven't found a solution within MapForce as yet, and I've found the support on the internet to be a bit sparse, but I'm hoping to get a solution when a colleague who has used this a bit more returns from holiday next week.<p />Any MapForce experts happen to be passing by?<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-115591465293594470?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
