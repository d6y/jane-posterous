I bought a couple of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_%28photography%29">filters</a> off <a href="http://search.ebay.co.uk/search/search.dll?cgiurl=http%3A%2F%2Fcgi.ebay.co.uk%2Fws%2F&amp;fkr=1&amp;from=R8&amp;satitle=filter&amp;category0=">ebay</a> last week, one is a polariser, the other is a skylight (1A).  I took a couple of photos with and without the <a href="http://www.photo96.com/tr/dp/cpl_01.htm">circular polarising filter</a> and the results are below.  I deliberately chose to shoot the sun in the image as I felt that this was going to emphasise the differences.  The first image was without the filter, and the second was with the filter.<p /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<p />I think it has made enough of a difference for that filter to become a standard when I'm likely to be shooting the sky.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-8188824829838586500?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
