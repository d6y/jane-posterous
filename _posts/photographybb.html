<p><a href="http://www.photographyblog.com/">PhotographyBlog</a> pointed me at <a href="http://www.photographybb.com/">PhotographyBB</a> the other day.  This is primarily an online magazine, producing a free PDF version monthly.  I downloaded the <a href="http://www.photographybb.com/site-news/photographybb-online-magazine-24th-edition/">most recent one</a>, popped it on my iPhone, and have been reading articles in it over the past few days.<p />In general, I haven't really been a big fan of PDF magazines, because I've never really found a good way to read them.  However, the iPhone works really well when combined with a 3rd party app - <a href="http://felaur.com/pdf/">Felaur PDF</a> - and it has been a pleasure.<p />The magazine is well put together, and informative.  I especially enjoyed the book review of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hollywood-Portraits-Classic-Shots-Take/dp/0817440208/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1264962175&amp;sr=8-1">Hollywood Portraits: Classic Shots and How to Take Them</a> and the suggestion to take a look at <a href="http://www.darkmansdarkroom.com">Larry &ldquo;Darkman&rdquo; Clark Darkmans Darkroom</a> and especially the photographs that <a href="http://www.darkmansdarkroom.com/hollywood- glamour-photos-and-how-to-take-them/">Larry has taken using the styles from the book</a>.<p />I've subscribed to the <a href="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/photographybb">PhotographyBB RSS feed</a> and will be using it to ensure I don't miss another edition.</p>
