<p>the focus should be less about the future of the book as we know it, and more about the future of reading. The future of different ways of reading. How we as publishers (or better yet: producers) can stay true to great looking storytelling in a way that will keep people excited about stories and excited about reading.</p>

<p>Really like this concept of thinking about "the future of reading" rather than getting hung up on the physical manifestation of the work. I'm going to try and think in this way more when talking about ebooks vs physical books etc. It's all about the enabling the work to be consumed in the most appropriate manner, regardless of whether that is digital or not</p>
