    <p>Spotted via <a href="http://www.iphoneography.com/">iPhoneography</a> <a href="http://www.iphoneography.com/journal/2010/3/7/pma-2010-through-the-lens-of-an-iphone-by-sion-fullana.html">over the weekend</a>.</p><p>This slide set, from the PMA 2010 keynote, gives an insight into just how impressive the imagery from an iPhone can be in the right hands.  New York based iPhoneographer <a href="http://www.sionfullana.com/">Sion Fullana</a> is definitely one set of these right hands. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sionfullana/">His flickr stream</a> provides more inspiration should you need it, and it is also very well labelled with what applications have been used to process the photos to help with application choice.</p><p>In recent weeks, I have found myself using <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/tags/iphone">my iPhone</a> more and more to take photographs, admittedly this is partially to do with the fact that I still have about 800 unprocessed photos from my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/tags/goeast">recent holiday</a> and the backlog is draining, but none the less, I'm still absolutely loving the creativity offered by <a href="http://hipstamaticapp.com/">hipstamatic</a>.</p></div>
