 <br /> <span style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 0px;">Web Awards Nomination</span></div>Brighton Bloggers has been shortlisted on the <a href="http://brightonwebawards.co.uk/vote">Brighton and Hove Web Awards</a> list in the Best Local Online Community category.<p />This is vaguely amusing as it because of my involvement with the Web Awards in 2003 that Brighton Bloggers was born out of a list produced by <a href="http://www.eventyr.co.uk/ramblings.html">Joh</a>.  It was originally intended to last for the length of the festival, but I felt this was a waste and decided to create Brighton Bloggers with help, support and encouragement at the time from <a href="http://www.petebarrwatson.com/">Pete</a> and <a href="http://adactio.com/">Jeremy</a>.  <p />Time has moved on, and the site now lists 267 bloggers who either work or live in Brighton and another successful meetup happened <a href="http://www.brightonbloggers.com/blog/archives/2007_11_01_index.php#8145247384104273462">just last week</a>.<p />Please consider supporting Brighton Bloggers by <a href="http://brightonwebawards.co.uk/vote">submitting your vote</a><br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-4481354318332781065?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
