 <br /> <span style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 0px;">  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/576501134/">Shrug!</a>  <br />  Originally uploaded by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/janed/">Jane Dallaway</a> </span></div>Last night I put aside my (very old) flash prejudice and headed over to <a href="http://www.aralbalkan.com/">Aral</a>'s beautiful flat for his presentation to <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/205667/">Flash Brighton on SWX</a>.  One of my reasons is because when Aral was first working on SWX, when it was still "<a href="http://www.aralbalkan.com/index.php?s=tangent">the tangent</a>" I bumped into Aral quite often and got snapshots of the development process - but that is all I got.  I listened in to some of his <a href="https://breeze.itap.purdue.edu/p62103321/">OSFlash SWX presentation</a> last week, but then got distracted by <a href="http://twitter.com/JaneFoth/statuses/105983692">beer at the Victory</a> and haven't had a change to listen to the rest.  The other reason was to see the <a href="http://www.nabaztag.com/en/index.html">Nabaztag bunny</a> that Aral gained at Hack Day - you can send the bunny a message from <a href="http://www.aralbalkan.com/">Aral's website</a>.<p />Aral put on a really good presentation, explaining in words that non-flash developers could understand.  His demo's <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/576704913/in/set-72157600411865418/">mostly worked</a> ;-) and the whole interface and method of working looked good and seemed to just make sense.  Great job Aral!<p />I spoke to quite a few Flash developers and designers and they didn't seem too upset to have a .NET developer in their midst (although at least one of them needs to get out more as I had a comment that they'd never met a female developer before). <p />My only experience of flash, other than as a user, was many years ago, 2000 or 2001 and I wasn't impressed - I didn't work with it, I just observed others and the work they produced.  It looked pretty but that was about it.<p />Having seen some flash yesterday and listened to Aral's talk I must admit to having seen flash in a new light.  I don't think I'm going to be giving up my back end development preference any time soon, but neither am I going to run away from flash either.  To be honest, I think my acceptance of flash has been progressing in the background for a while - <a href="http://www.niquimerret.com/">Niqui</a> gave a good presentation at the <a href="http://www.brightongirlgeekdinners.co.uk/geekdinners/show/March+2007+Dinner">Girl Geek Dinners</a> on accessibility.<p />So, a great evening, slightly outside of my comfort zone, but big thanks to <a href="http://www.flashbrighton.org/wordpress/">Flash Brighton</a> for putting on such a good session, and to everyone for being so accepting of a non-flash person.<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-393260009466403105?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
