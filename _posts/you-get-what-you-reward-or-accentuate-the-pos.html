I was reading the introduction from my copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0761121390/ref=ox_ya_oh_product">The 1001 Rewards and Recognition Fieldbook: The Complete Guide</a> the other day when I spotted a similarity between it and another book.<p />The 1001 Rewards and Recognition Fieldbook says<br /><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">There are, however, certain basic truths in management that you can always rely on.

Good things happen when your dog does well!  Ignore or correct behaviour you don't want to encourage.  Sounds simple. but many people do exactly the opposite without meaning to.  Never, ever use harsh punishment.</blockquote><p />So, there you are, getting good behaviours in employees or dogs is the same - presumably the reward differs.  Maybe I'll try offering my team a <a href="http://www.petspantry.tv/acatalog/pedigree-gravy-bones.html">gravy bone</a> and see if I get the behaviour I want...<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-5236247362000919001?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
