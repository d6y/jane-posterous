<p>On Saturday, whilst wandering around Margate, we popped in to <a href="http://piefactorymargate.co.uk/">The Pie Factory</a> to see what exhibition they had on <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/heather-barnett-margate-photo-fest">this time</a>. It turned out to be <a href="http://pushingprint.co.uk/">Pushing Print</a> - an exhibition of printmaking.</p>
<p>The stand out exhibit for me was <a href="http://www.tinahillart.co.uk/section375147.html">Excavating Babel</a> by <a href="http://www.tinahillart.co.uk/">Tina Hill</a>. It's a structure, representing the story of Genesis <a href="http://www.tinahillart.co.uk/section375147_127996.html">apparently</a>, made up of approximately 2,500 books which is big enough to stand inside and to have your vision and communication to the outside world blocked by books. Quite wonderful really.</p>
<p>Tina Hills&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tinahillart.co.uk/section375147_129086.html">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Excavating Babel is also a monument to books in general and on a personal level, the important place they have played in my life.</blockquote>
<p>It reminded me of being in a second hand book shop in Hull that my Mum used to visit to stock up on books - there were always piles of books, seemingly randomly placed.</p>
<p>My kindle can hold approximately 3,500 books, so another 1000 on top of this, quite astounding really, and really gave me a sense of the scale of the number of words I can fit onto such a small device.</p>
