<p>It took a while, but we've finally reviewed our <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/static-code-analysis">static code analysis tools</a> and made a proposal to use FxCop.<p />Of the tools we evaluated there were 2 main contenders - <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/static-code-analysis-review-fxcop">FxCop</a> and <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/static-code-analysis-review-codeitright">Submain CodeIt.Right</a> which I've covered in more detail in other blog posts.  <p />The other tools, NDepend, Visual Assist and Resharper, didn't get close enough to <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/static-code-analysis-review-our-criteria">our criteria</a> on a number of points.  <a href="http://www.ndepend.com/">NDepend</a> and <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">Resharper</a> look like valuable tools, but not under the mantle of what we wanted from static code analysis.  <a href="http://www.wholetomato.com/">VisualAssist</a> was more of a tool to help whilst you type - adding to the intellisense and providing prompts for syntax violations. <p />Note: We don't run Visual Studio team edition so there is no built in code analysis tool</p>
