    <p>In June I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/archives/date-posted/2010/06/calendar/">uploaded 127 items</a> to flickr.</p><p>I have now posted a complete year's worth of Favourite upload photos, so for this month I thought I'd post a "could have been favourite" <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/tag/uploadofthemonth">upload of the month</a></p><p>This is a photograph I like, but it is also one that I can see plenty of "it would have been better if"s with.  So, I like the interaction between the two golden figures, I like the expression on the guys face but I feel it would have better without the photographer (I think) in the background (the guy with the blue jacket and arms raised as if wielding a camera just behind the guys right arm).  I also feel it would have been better to have been a little bit wider and got all of the guy's left hand and more of the ladies back into the shot.</p><p>This photograph was taken at the <a href="http://www.thanet.gov.uk/leisure__culture/margate_big_event.aspx">Margate Big Event</a> on a cloudy and, later, rainy Sunday using my Nikon d80 and processed using Lightroom.</p><p>I'll probably return to the more usual format next month.</p></div>
