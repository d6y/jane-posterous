<a href="http://www.joshrussell.com/">Josh</a> and <a href="http://www.builtbydave.co.uk/">Dave</a>, the guys behind <a href="http://dashlabs.com/">Dash Labs</a> recently introduced <a href="">Sussex Digital</a>, a service to let the people in Sussex know what is going on around and about.  They are introducing a new section every week, and so far have given us <a href="http://twitter.com/sussexdigital/">twitter reminders of events and other notifications of interest</a>, <a href="http://www.sussexdigital.com/events">events list</a> and information about the <a href="http://www.sussexdigital.com/networks">local networking opportunities and groups</a>.  What they've done is effectively aggregated a lot of feeds with relevant information into one hub.  A great idea.  <p />Yesterday they also launched their <a href="http://www.sussexdigital.com/buttons">buttons</a> so in the interest of community I've added one to the bottom of this page, and thought I'd add one here as well so here we go:<br /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
