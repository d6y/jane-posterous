<p>I'm not sure who pointed me at <a href="http://www.everythingisaremix.info">Everything is a remix</a>, it was probably via a tweet or a blog post. But, I'm glad that whoever it was did so. Video 3, included below, is well worth watching (as are the other 2 in <a href="http://www.everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/">the series</a> so far, #4 is due out in autumn) - a useful reminder that ideas beget ideas, and that copying is a great way to learn.&nbsp;</p>
