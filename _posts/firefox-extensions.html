My laptop went in for repair last week, and whilst it was there having its power cable replaced (internal burning) and screen replaced (deal pixels) I upgrade its hard-drive to be a nice and healthy 120GB.  I didn't copy any data across, and after a few hours of re-installs I'm pretty much there, with much thanks to having listed <a href="http://osx.iusethis.com/user/janedallaway">my most used applications</a> on <a href="http://osx.iusethis.com/">iusethis</a>.<p />That leaves the firefox extensions though, so I thought I'd list my most used ones here as a record for myself:<ul><li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843">Firebug</a> (obviously) </li><li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1146">Screengrab</a></li><li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/655">View Source Chart</a></li><li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/126">TinyURL Creator</a></li></ul><p />If you have some additional extensions that you think are great, let me know and I'll give them a go too<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-7277008094240302559?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
