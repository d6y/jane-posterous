                	<p>Graffiti-ridden derelict sites have been given a much needed face-lift  with extraordinary light art by Tigtab. Each image is created with the  help of stencils. These intricate designs are revealed after a burst  from a camera flash lights up the inside of the box. In this picture, a  pond scene is created in a flooded derelict building.<span></span></p>

<p>She said : “My photos are predominantly shot using urban backdrops. I  find beauty in decay – those abandoned and forgotten places all around  us. By bringing light into the darkness of each space, it fills that  space for a moment in time, and highlights both their beauty and  impermanence”</p>

<p>Much like Banksy, Tigtab, from Melbourne, Australia, keeps her identity a  closely guarded secret</p>
<p><a href="http://oddstuffmagazine.com/extraordinary-light-stencil-urban-art-pictures-by-tigtab.html/screen-shot-2010-06-22-at-6-47-58-pm" rel="attachment wp-att-1311"><img title="Screen shot 2010-06-22 at 6.47.58 PM" src="http://oddstuffmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Screen-shot-2010-06-22-at-6.47.58-PM-580x441.png" height="380" alt="" width="500" /></a></p><p></p>
<p>Under cover of darkness, she can spend up to four hours creating just  one photo</p>
<p><a href="http://oddstuffmagazine.com/extraordinary-light-stencil-urban-art-pictures-by-tigtab.html/screen-shot-2010-06-22-at-6-49-13-pm" rel="attachment wp-att-1312"><img title="Screen shot 2010-06-22 at 6.49.13 PM" src="http://oddstuffmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Screen-shot-2010-06-22-at-6.49.13-PM.png" height="623" alt="" width="423" /></a></p><p></p>
<p>Tigtab creates her images using stencils</p>
<p><a href="http://oddstuffmagazine.com/extraordinary-light-stencil-urban-art-pictures-by-tigtab.html/screen-shot-2010-06-22-at-6-50-52-pm" rel="attachment wp-att-1313"><img title="Screen shot 2010-06-22 at 6.50.52 PM" src="http://oddstuffmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Screen-shot-2010-06-22-at-6.50.52-PM-580x392.png" height="337" alt="" width="500" /></a></p><p></p>
<p>The stencils are placed on light boxes lined with silver foil. The  intricate designs are revealed after a burst from a camera flash lights  up the inside of the box very briefly</p>
<p><a href="http://oddstuffmagazine.com/extraordinary-light-stencil-urban-art-pictures-by-tigtab.html/screen-shot-2010-06-22-at-6-51-45-pm" rel="attachment wp-att-1314"><img title="Screen shot 2010-06-22 at 6.51.45 PM" src="http://oddstuffmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Screen-shot-2010-06-22-at-6.51.45-PM-580x468.png" height="403" alt="" width="500" /></a></p><p></p>
<p>Tigtab moves around the room, tunnel or drain, repositioning the  stencils and firing the flash repeatedly while the shutter of the camera  is left open to create complex designs</p>
<p><a href="http://oddstuffmagazine.com/extraordinary-light-stencil-urban-art-pictures-by-tigtab.html/screen-shot-2010-06-22-at-6-52-57-pm" rel="attachment wp-att-1315"><img title="Screen shot 2010-06-22 at 6.52.57 PM" src="http://oddstuffmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Screen-shot-2010-06-22-at-6.52.57-PM-580x390.png" height="336" alt="" width="500" /></a></p><p></p>
<p>The end result is so polished Tigtab said people often assume her work  is computer generated. She said: “Speechless is a good description of  people’s initial reactions to date. They will often stare in awe, unable  to verbalise initially what they are seeing. I find that people keep  returning to certain images, which is a wonderful compliment”</p>

<p>“Some people don’t realise that they are images that I have created, and  then shot within that location,” she said. “They assume that they are  entirely constructed within a computer, which is incorrect”</p>

    <p>Wow.  These are beautiful.  I especially like the use of the urban landscape as the canvas, and can only imagine the amount of effort that must go into these photographs.</p></div>
