    <p>In January I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/archives/date-posted/2011/01/calendar/">uploaded 70 public photos to flickr<p>This photo was taken on my iPhone and is part of my <a href="http://janeonthemove.posterous.com/tag/365">365</a> <a href="http://janeonthemove.posterous.com/pages/projects-57">project</a></p><p>I like the reflection and contrast of a concrete block next to a more traditional, and in keeping with its neighbours, regency style building.</p><p>I found January generally to be a very busy, but pretty uninspiring month, and I didn't take many photographs that weren't part of the 365 project (and I even struggled to keep that going too)</p></a></p></div>
