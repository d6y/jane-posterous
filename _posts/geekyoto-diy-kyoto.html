<br /><span style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 0px;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/2505946903/">Diy Kyoto</a><br />Originally uploaded by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/janed/">Jane Dallaway</a></span></div>One of the two product based talks last Saturday at <a href="http://geekyoto.com/">geekyoto</a> was <a href="http://www.diykyoto.com/">DIY Kyoto</a>.    The key product is <a href="http://www.diykyoto.com/wattson/about">Wattson</a> a well designed item which glows with a different colour according to how much electricity you're using, and also shows the electricity usage in either watts or price (you can set your own price).  It is based in London, and made in London too.<p />There is also an associate tool, <a href="http://www.diykyoto.com/holmes/about">Holmes</a> which provides a web-based view of your data - Wattson stores 28 days internally and Holmes that to be visualised.<p />I had a brief chat with Greta Corke (pictured) during a break and it sounded like a more fun (and prettier) version than some of the other similar functioning units.  There's a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRPskwgueDA">video</a> from Designers Block 2006 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRPskwgueDA">here</a>.<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-8491015198972284572?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
