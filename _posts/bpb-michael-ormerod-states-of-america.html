<p>At lunchtime today I headed over to the <a href="http://www.cranekalmanbrighton.com">Brighton CraneKalman</a> gallery to view the <a href="http://www.photofringe.org/">Brighton Photography Fringe</a>&nbsp;exhibition&nbsp;<a href="http://www.photofringe.org/?p=203">Michael Ormerod: States of America</a>. The exhibition is described as</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>The first exhibition in nearly a decade for one of British photography&rsquo;s most powerful and distinctive voices whose career was tragically cut short in a road accident in 1991. Fascinated by the American image, Ormerod took to the Mid-West to find a land where the American Dream had turned sour. His images capture a strange juxtaposition of an American beauty tainted by a hidden sense of menace and corruption. &lsquo;States of America&rsquo; was published shortly after he died.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There were three stand out images for me,&nbsp;all for different reasons:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://www.cranekalmanbrighton.com/exhibitions/ormerod/mo_08.html">Girl Blowing Bubble Gum</a>&nbsp;I liked for the quality of the light, and the beautiful range of colours reproduced (the version on the web page linked to here doesn't do it justice). &nbsp;This is my favourite of the ones on display</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://www.cranekalmanbrighton.com/exhibitions/ormerod/mo_04.html">Planning Board</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;I like because it appealed to <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/out-of-place">my sense of the temporary and unique</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cranekalmanbrighton.com/exhibitions/ormerod/mo_06.html">Man and Arrow</a>&nbsp;I like again because of the light, but also because the arrow is just mad, is colour coordinated with the man's hat and dominates the landscape</p>
<p>The book that this exhibition is based on is available at the gallery (or on Amazon - see <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0948797673?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=janedall-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0948797673">States of America</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=janedall-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=0948797673" border="0" height="1" alt="" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" /> ). &nbsp;I managed to walk away without buying a copy today, but I can't help but wonder how many more books will be sitting on my <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography-bookshelf">Photography Bookshelf</a> by the end of the month.</p>
<p>The exhibition is definitely worth a visit if you're passing, and as I popped into the Iydea cafe to pick up some lunch, there were <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/bpb-the-daily-swim">The Daily Swim</a> photos on the wall too, so you can easily combine two exhibitions in just a short walk down Kensington Gardens.</p>
