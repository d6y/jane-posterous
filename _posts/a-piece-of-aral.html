I sent it through to him and he briefly explained what he had planned.  <p />He's just <a href="http://aralbalkan.com/1339">blogged about it</a>.  He has split the photo into 100 moo card shaped images, and has produced a moo card mosaic.  So, if you meet Aral in the near future, you might get a bit of his face on a moo card.<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-8587517855056835364?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
