<p>I explained my <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/tag/storyline">storyline project</a> to a few people the other week, and realised that I needed a much shorter, snappier, understandable explanation. Here's what I've got to so far:</p>
<p>"When Mum&rsquo;s carers put her to bed for bed rest in an afternoon I'd like them to be able to choose the right thing to leave on her TV for her, the thing she&rsquo;d have chosen"</p>
<p>Mum is entirely dependent on others to make her decisions for her. I make the financial and long-term care provision choices. The team at her home make the medical and short-medium term care choices. Her key-worker and other carers make the day-to-day small decisions. It&rsquo;s these decisions that the storyline has the power to influence. And it's these that probably make the biggest difference to her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I mean is that I know that if I'm somewhere where the TV is on, and it's on a channel showing a programme I'd never choose to watch, and yet the person who put it on has left the room and taken the remote control with them, I'm likely to get a bit frustrated or annoyed. I have the ability to get up and go somewhere else, or ask for the control, or do any number of other things to resolve this for myself. But Mum doesn't. Mum is at the mercy of others to choose wisely for her. So, what I want to achieve via this storyline project is to to give her carers enough background knowledge to help them make as many of these little choices in the most appropriate way possible.</p>
