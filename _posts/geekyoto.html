The subject was "Fixing The Broken World" and we had 15 different speakers during the day covering topics from politics, products, mapping through to playing.  A really enjoyable and thought provoking day.<p />I'll post some more thoughts and reflections as the week progresses, but in the meantime <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157605147816095/">here are some photos</a>.<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-174405577342580708?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
