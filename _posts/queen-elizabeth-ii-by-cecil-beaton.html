    <p>A couple of weeks ago I paid a visit to the <a href="http://www.npg.org.uk/">National Portrait Gallery</a> and whilst I was there found a small panel showing some of Cecil Beaton's photographs of the Queen, and I was completely taken aback by them, the naturalness of them but also the theatricalness of them.</p><p>When I returned home and looked it up, I realised that I'd missed the <a href="http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/exhibitions/cecilbeaton/about-the-exhibition/">V&A's exhibition</a> but that they'd produced an <a href="http://www.vandashop.com/product.php?xProd=8945&amp;xSec=30&amp;navlock=1">accompanying book</a>. Which I ordered. </p><p>Last weekend I devoured it. The portraits are marvellous. The majority of them look incredibly natural, and not forced or as incredibly formal as many others depicting the Royal Family. I am particularly taken with the one shown above, showing the Queen and Prince Charles, as it looks like it could be of any mother and son, and I think that is what I like about them, the accessibility of them. Obviously, there are several with crowns and regal paraphernalia, but there are also ones which are just family pictures, not unlike ones I have in my archive too (only nowhere near as well taken sadly!)</p></div>
