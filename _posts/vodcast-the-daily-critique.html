Since getting my iPod touch I've been on the lookout for good photography related video based podcasts.  I've <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photography/photoblog/2008/01/adobe-lightroom-videocasts.html">previously mentioned some of my favourite Lightroom instruction/tutorial ones</a>, but I recently came across <a href="http://www.radiantvista.com/">Radiant Vista</a>'s <a href="http://www.radiantvista.com/critique">The Daily Critique</a>.  <p />This vodcast takes an image or a series of images and then critiques them in a constructive and pleasant manner.  The video aspects are simple - primarily the photograph is displayed and a red marker is used to highlight areas that the commentary is paying particular attention to.  This simple approach is a great tool for people like myself to learn from.  And, because it is a digital image, <a href="http://www.craigtannercreative.com/">Craig</a> (the reviewer) has the ability to actually edit the photo and show what impact some seemingly simple manipulations can make to it.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-571266676088863281?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
