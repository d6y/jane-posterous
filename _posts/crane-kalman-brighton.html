    <p>Yesterday one of the design team mentioned to me that they had popped in to <a href="http://www.cranekalmanbrighton.com/">Crane Kalman</a> and bought a small book of images from the FOTO8 summershow exhibition.  So, at lunchtime today, I went for a quick look and came away myself with a copy of the book too.  One of the photographs that caught my eye when I was looking through Francesca's copy was by <a href="http://www.rchivers.co.uk/">Richard Chivers</a>, an artist who I <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/brighton-photo-fringe">bought an exhibition souvenir from</a> during the <a href="http://www.bpb.org.uk/">Brighton Photo Biennial</a> 2008.  Anyways, the exhibition is on until the 30th September, and is worth a look.  Next year, assuming they do the summertime collection next year, I'm planning to head to London to take a look at <a href="http://www.foto8.com/new/summer-show-mainmenu-191">the full collection</a>.</p></div>
