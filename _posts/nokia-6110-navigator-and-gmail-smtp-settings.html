I'm just back from a weeks holiday, during which I used my 6110 Navigator to check my emails every now and again.  Unfortunately I didn't quite have the settings sorted out completely to allow me to send email from my phone, so I had to wait until I got home to a proper internet connection again to investigate further and <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?ctx=%67mail&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;answer=12103">review what those settings should be</a>.  Anyway, for the record, those settings (found under Messaging -> Options: Settings -> Email -> Mailboxes -> [mailbox name] -> Connection Settings -> Outgoing e-mail) are:<p /> My e-mail address, User name and password - normal settings<br />Outgoing mail server: smtp.googlemail.com<br />Security (ports): StartTLS<br />Port: 587<p />This seems to work :-)<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-5794855593974885632?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
