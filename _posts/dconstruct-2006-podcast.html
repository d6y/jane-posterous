<a href="http://2006.dconstruct.org/">d.Construct 2006</a> is a mere few weeks away now, and although I'm not going to be attending, I have subscribed to the <a href="http://2006.dconstruct.org/podcast/">podcast</a>.&nbsp; I'm finding it really good - reasonably short programmes with web related content, focussed a lot on Brighton people and businesses.&nbsp; It's proving to be a great way to find out about what is going on in local web companies, and <a href="http://adactio.com/about/">Jeremy</a> is a natural presenter.<br /><a href="http://performancing.com/firefox/handbook/tour/launch"></a><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-115575381756327348?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
