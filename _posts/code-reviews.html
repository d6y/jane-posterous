My .Net advice is not up to the standard I'd like it to be yet, but I'm trying to work on that. <p />Thankfully, no-one has ever presented me with code like <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/forums/thread/81930.aspx">this</a>.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-115322769533456685?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
