<p>On Monday evening I headed down to <a href="http://www.brightonlife.com/news/the-eagle-bar-bakery-first-for-food-163.html">the Eagle</a> to attend <a href="http://www.joshrussell.com/">Josh</a>'s  <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/322716/">Silverlight Night</a>.  It wasn't really a presentation so much as a set of demos, around which a lot of questions and answers went on - especially from the <a href="http://www.flashbrighton.org/wordpress/">Flash Brighton</a> crowd.  This was the first time I'd really spent any time learning about <a href="http://silverlight.net/">Silverlight</a>, and I found the session really informative.  I appreciate it isn't as mature a product as flash but I also don't really think it is targeting the same audience at this time - probably being best suited to video players and kiosk style applications.  I really believe that the integration with other Microsoft toolsets, like the .NET languages, Visual Studio, Expression Blend, can only be a good thing allowing developers and designers to work together with a greater amount of ease.  This is long overdue in my opinion.<p />It's great to get more Microsoft speakers down to Brighton - following on from <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/vbug-brighton-visual-studio-2008-and-net-fram&quot;">Daniel Moth's attendance at VBUG</a> a few weeks previously - and having spoken with <a href="http://www.petebarrwatson.com/">Pete</a> during the event I'm hopeful that he can help get more evenings like this arranged.<p />A few days after the presentation, I received an email from Microsoft informing me that the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/uk/mix07/">Mix:UK 07</a> <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/uk/mix07/agenda.aspx">videos</a> were available.  I'd heard great things about the conference and so followed the link and discovered that they'd all been encoded using Silverlight - so I guess I'll be installing it pretty soon.  Amongst the sessions are a couple of interest re Silverlight - "Designing immersive experiences with Expression Blend, WPF and Silverlight" and  "Building Silverlight Applications using .NET (Parts 1 and 2)" which I'm hoping to find time to follow up on in the next month or so.</p>
