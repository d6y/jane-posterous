      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>Anwita explains, "My work is an investigation into how old objects can perpetuate memories. I write biographies by imprinting memories in the form of photographs, letters and writings onto personalised objects, using hand screen printing and embroidery. These objects then become part of an installation." </p><p> She believes, "Storytelling is an inseparable bond that brings together generations - a bond that creates a feeling of oneness and belonging."</p></blockquote><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/fashion/trends/Gift-a-memory/articleshow/10539790.cms?intenttarget=no">timesofindia.indiatimes.com</a></div>
