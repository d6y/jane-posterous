Ok, so I live in Brighton, and on Monday it snowed.  So, it is only right and proper (if a little bit predictable) that I have photos of the West Pier in the snow.  We headed down to the seafront at around 7am, just as the light was changing from night to day, and before the snow was all tracked out.  The pier, with its light dusting of snow, and with the typical snowy muffling of all sounds around, was slightly spooky but also incredibly beautiful. <p /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
