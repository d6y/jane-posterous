<p>Dawn, my NVQ Assessor, came into the office yesterday for a catch-up after a couple of missed appointments.  I'd already emailed through my "homework" from last time to get some feedback, and so Dawn was able to let me know what the last remaining points I need to address to get module <a href="http://www.management-standards.org/content_1.aspx?id=10:2295&amp;id=10:2076&amp;id=10:2012&amp;id=10:1917">E6 - Ensure health and safety requirements are met in your area of responsibility</a> out of the way.  I'm aiming to get this done before I see her next, and then that will be 4 of my 7 modules done.</p>
<p>We then went through the details of my one remaining mandatory module<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; line-height: 15px;">, B6 - Provide leadership in your area of responsibility, <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">which I'm going to tackle next.  Fortunately, a lot of the outcomes, behaviours and knowledge items can be re-used from earlier modules, so there are only 7 or 8 extra pieces of evidence I need to find, or statements to write.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; line-height: 15px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Work is pretty busy at the moment, with the project I've been working on ramping up towards it's launch date, as well as doing the day to day management activities and it being appraisal time, so I've started making appointments with Dawn a little less frequent so that I can try and find some spare time (usually evenings or weekends) to crack on and crank out the evidence.</span></span></p>
