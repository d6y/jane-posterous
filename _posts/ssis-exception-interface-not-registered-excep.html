I've got some handover documents to write, and as I'm working from home on Monday I thought I'd set the laptop up to enable me to do this.  One of the things I need to document is the SSIS export I wrote last year.  I started up the laptop, and tried to open up the project and got a "Interface not registered (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80040155)" message.  Not helpful.  A quick search on google pointed me at a seemingly <a href="https://forums.microsoft.com/TechNet/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=1270101&amp;SiteID=17">unrelated post on a TechNet forum</a>, but at the very bottom is the solution from James McAuliffe.  The solution, for me, was:<p /><i>Navigate to the following folders:<p />C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\VSA\8.0\common\<br />C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\VSA\8.0\vsa<p />In each of those folders run this command to re-register everything in there.:<p /><span class="code">for %i in (*.dll) do RegSvr32 -s %i</span></i><p />The project opens now, but leaves me with a "Creating an instance of the COM component with CLSID {E80FE1DB-D1AA-4D6B-BA7E-040D424A925C} from the IClassFactory failed due to the following error: c001f011."
