</span><div class="description"><p>Having recently bought a Nokia 6110 Navigator, a phone with a 2MP camera, I wondered what helpful hints and tips this book could give me. </p><p>The book is split into 5 chapters which cover</p><ol><li>Choosing a camera phone</li><li>Taking Pictures</li><li>After the snap</li><li>The camera phone community</li><li>Troubleshooting</li></ol><p>As I had already bought my phone based on other functionality, much of the advice in chapter one was too late for me although there was still a good section on accessories along with appropriate links.</p><p>Unsurprisingly many of the techniques in the Taking photos chapter are the standard set - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds">rule of thirds</a>, using ISO settings to compensate for lack of light, shutter speed and aperture etc etc.  The camera on my phone doesn't allow access to all of these settings.</p><p>After the snap concentrates on what happens next - covering printing, sharing on mobile social networks (including some I'd never heard of - like <a href="http://fotochatter.com/">fotochatter</a>), digital frames and of course on-line galleries.</p><p>The community chapter covers mobile blogging, more about on-line galleries and camera phone cinema (I didn't realise there were camera phone festivals) including linnks and reviews of a number of providers of the various services.</p><p>The final chapter, troubleshooting, is what you'd expect but has an intersting paragraph about what to do if you've dropped your phone into salt water, chlorinated water or a fizzy drink (wash it in distilled water apparently).</p><p>All in all a great introductory book to the world of cameras in general, but obviously with a heavy mobile bias.  The included links are relevant, and useful and all come with an explanation of what the service/site has to offer.</p><br /></div><abbr class="rating" title="4"></abbr><p class="reviewer vcard">Review by <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/" class="url fn">Jane Dallaway</a>, <abbr class="dtreviewed" title="200710">October 2007</abbr></p></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-3483958523415801830?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
