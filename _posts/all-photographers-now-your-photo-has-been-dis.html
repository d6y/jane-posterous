<p>A few weeks ago I received an email from the <a href="http://www.elysee.ch/">Musee de l'Elysee</a> inviting me, as <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/were-all-photographers-now">a contributor to</a> the 2007 <a href="http://www.allphotographersnow.ch/index.php">We are all photographers now</a> exhibition, to take part in the new <a href="http://www.tousphotographes.ch/index.en.php">We are all photographers of the public space!</a></p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>The adventure continues around a specific theme:&nbsp;<strong>the public space</strong>. Can one photograph everything in the public space? What are its visual benchmarks? What is unusual about it? When does it become private?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I decided to contribute one of my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157603406264874/with/5024074692/">found</a> <a href="http://janeonthemove.posterous.com/pages/projects-57">project</a> photographs, selecting <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4998815759/">Found: 2 arm chairs</a> as, to me at least, this scene was unusual, with chairs like these being normally in a private space rather than a public space, and with the road markings making it evident and obvious that these were indeed in a public space</p>
<p>Today I received the following email, letting me know that my photograph was displayed, and including a photograph of my photograph being projected - on which I can count at least 6 heads watching. &nbsp;Overall, pretty pleased.</p>
