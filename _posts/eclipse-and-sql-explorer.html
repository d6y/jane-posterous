<p>At home I use the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">eclipse development environment</a> and so, after my <a href="http://files.shinydevelopment.com/RailsForDotNetProgrammersDDD4.pdf">introduction to Ruby on Rails</a> on <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/webdd-overview">Saturday</a>, I started reading up on <a href="http://www.radrails.org/">RadRails</a>, a Ruby on Rails IDE which plugs in to eclipse.  Through reading up I discovered the eclipse <a href="http://www.sqlexplorer.org/">SQL Explorer</a> plugin, which (with a little help from Richard and from <a href="http://www.radrails.org/tag/radrailstutorials">a tutorial</a>) is now working on my mac and which looks like a great interface to many different databases.</p>
