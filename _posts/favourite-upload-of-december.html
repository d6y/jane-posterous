<p>In December I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/archives/date-posted/2009/12/calendar/">uploaded 176 photos</a>.<p />This photo is of Richard's feet, on the steps to a subway in Hong Kong.<p />This photo was taken with the iPhone camera, and was part of the collection of images that I uploaded whilst on my travels - there are 1709 photos to work through taken with the D80 (so they may be under consideration for many months to come).  The photo was processed on the phone using the <a href="http://shakeitphoto.com/">ShakeItPhoto</a> app, which at 59p is a bargain.<p />I have chosen this photo because I like the composition and colours after ShakeItPhoto has done its magic, and it reminds me of being in Hong Kong</p>
