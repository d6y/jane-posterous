<p>Last night <a href="http://madgex.com/">Madgex</a> hosted an excellent <a href="http://www.vbug.co.uk/">VBUG</a> Brighton session by <a href="http://miketaulty.com">Mike Taulty</a> on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Integrated_Query">LINQ</a>.<p />Despite the sunny, warm evening we managed to pack 25 or so Microsoft technologies developers into our boardroom and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/2636262475/">listened intently</a> whilst Mike talked and demo'd his way around LINQ, explaining some of the newer C#/VB9 language features as he went.  Whilst not being the exact same slide deck, after a rummage around Mike's site I found a <a href="http://mtaulty.com/CommunityServer/blogs/mike_taultys_blog/archive/2008/03/20/10255.aspx">post</a> about a similar sounding talk complete with presentation in <a href="http://mtaulty.com/downloads/MTLaunchLINQ.pdf">PDF</a> format.<p />I remain slightly dissapointed by the syntax for Linq to XML <br /><span class="code">var query = from c in data.DescendantsAndSelf("customer")<br /> select (string)c.Attribute("id");</span><br /> which as Mike said, involves a bit too much of hoping and praying (relying on no underlying changes, no strong typing etc).<p />However, I'm really encouraged by the idea of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/xmlteam/archive/2008/02/21/linq-to-xsd-alpha-0-2.aspx">Linq to XSD</a> which seems like a much better idea, tying the query to a schema rather than a document.<p /><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/fmarguerie/">Fabrice</a> has <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/fmarguerie/archive/2007/01/15/linq-to-xsd-typed-xml-programming-with-linq.aspx">some sample code based on Linq to XML and Linq to XSD</a> as follows, which goes to show the improvement using the XSD version<p />Here is a LINQ to XML query:<br /><span class="code">from item in purchaseOrder.Elements("Item")<br />select (double)item.Element("Price") * (int)item.Element("Quantity")</span><p />Here is the same query as above, but written using LINQ to XSD:<br /><span class="code">from item in purchaseOrder.Item<br />select item.Price * item.Quantity</span><br />which I think looks much more elegant and less clunky.</p>
