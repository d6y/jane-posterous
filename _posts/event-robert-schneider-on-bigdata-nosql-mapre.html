<p>This evening I headed in to London to <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/">SkillsMatter</a> to hear <a href="http://rdschneider.com/">Robert Schneider</a> talk about <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/nosql/big-data-nosql-mapreduce-and-hadoop-four-concepts-that-every-software-architect-and-developer-should-understand">BigData, NoSQL, MapReduce and Hadoop</a></p>
<p>As a new iPad owner I was interested in experimenting and using my iPad as my note taking device, and as I often use mind-map style drawings for my event notes these days, I made use of <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bamboo-paper-notebook/id443131313?mt=8">Bamboo Paper</a> and a stylus. What follows are my scrawlings.</p>
<p>First - Big Data</p>

<p>Second - NoSQL</p>
<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7265/6998126687_b90a9ef4a7.jpg" height="500" alt="2012-03-19 22.01.34" width="375" /></p>

<p>Third - MapReduce</p>
<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7088/6852003172_4fee618d33.jpg" height="500" alt="2012-03-19 22.01.44" width="375" /></p>
<p>Fourth - Hadoop (including a photo)</p>
<p><img src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6100/6998127477_153b60d8fe.jpg" height="500" alt="2012-03-19 22.01.49" width="375" /></p>

<p>Finally - hands on guides</p>
<p><img src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6218/6998127865_ae476228b7.jpg" height="500" alt="2012-03-19 22.01.54" width="375" /></p>
<p>Some of the questions and answers were really interesting - especially around what skills a data based start up be looking for? Answer: some relational guys, some nosql guys - the experience of the relational people is still valuable, whilst people who aren't constrained by relational are also valuable.</p>
<p>It was quite a trip to get to Clerkenwell from Brighton and back again for an hour long talk, but it was worth it. Not because I learnt a lot, but because I already understood quite a few of the concepts being covered, and that means that my current learning process is working, and that reading books like <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022640.do">Big Data Now: Current Perspectives from O'Reilly Radar</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/jan/06/facts-sacred-guardian-shorts-ebook">Facts are sacred: the power of data</a>&nbsp;as well as submerging myself in blog posts and webcasts and other related resources is making a difference.</p>
<p>In related news, I've since bought a copy of the bamboo paper app as it was quite usable, and I like the fact I can either export pages as jpgs or export an entire notebook as a pdf sending it directly to evernote if I choose to.</p>
