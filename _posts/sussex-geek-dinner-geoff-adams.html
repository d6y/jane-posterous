<a href="http://upcoming.org/event/151497/">Last night</a> was another <a href="http://sussex.geekdinner.co.uk/">Sussex Geek Dinner</a>.  Again held at the Black Horse, this evening featured a presentation by <a href="http://www.oakenpage.com/">Geoff Adams</a> on <a href="http://www.pmachine.com/">Expression Engine</a>, a CMS that I'd never heard of before.  The talk took the format of a tutorial (presented on a flip chart as the Black Horse isn't the most technically equipped pub in the world), and certainly gave an indication of how flexible and powerful Expression Engine is.  <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/jnicho02/">Jez</a> has also used this CMS and so had some additional comments to make during question time.  <a href="http://littlespikeyland.com/">John</a> and <a href="http://ianozsvald.com/">Ian</a> stood up and talked about their <a href="http://ianozsvald.com/2007/02/28/5-apps-a-new-geek-meet/">$5 app idea</a>, and <a href="http://yandleblog.blogspot.com/">Danny</a> mentioned the <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/152710/">Think what you would do if only you had the money then figure out how you can do it anyway</a> meeting today.  Shortly before the end of the main talk, I heard someone say "Christmas Trees" in an incredibly loud voice, I did think I was going mad, but <a href="http://www.eventyr.co.uk/">Joh</a> heard it too.<p />My conversations of the evening ranged from photography with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ribot/">Ribot</a> and <a href="http://yandleblog.blogspot.com/">Danny</a>, Hong Kong Phooey and Doctor Who with <a href="http://ianozsvald.com/">Ian</a>, childrens tv and rock climbing with Steve, podcasts and screencasts about other podcasts and screencasts with <a href="http://www.summitsolutions.co.uk/">Andy</a>, wine and geeks with <a href="http://yandleblog.blogspot.com/">Danny</a> and <a href="http://blog.spiralarm.com/richard/">Richard</a>, Kendal mint cake with Steve, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ribot/">Ribot</a> and <a href="http://happygiraffe.net/blog/">Dom</a> and the <a href="http://www.brightongirlgeekdinners.co.uk/">Brighton Girl Geek Dinners</a> with <a href="http://www.eventyr.co.uk/">Joh</a> and Jen.<p />Another great evening, and I'm looking forward to <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/151497/">the next one</a> as I couldn't get into <a href="http://www.glennjones.net/Home/">Glenn Jones</a>'s session about Microformats at WebDD recently and so am really glad to get another opportunity.<p /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
