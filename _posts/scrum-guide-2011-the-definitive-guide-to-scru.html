<p>I've been working with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)">Scrum</a> based project for a few months now, and in preparation read&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0201710919/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=janedall-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0201710919">Planning Extreme Programming (XP)</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=janedall-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=0201710919" border="0" height="1" alt="" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" />&nbsp;(as I'm overseeing from a process/responsibilitiy angle rather than actively developing on it) which I reviewed at the time as being</p>

<p>I stumbled across <a href="http://www.scrum.org/scrumguides/#">The Scrum Guide</a> last week, and have just spent the past hour or so reading it and found it a really valuable use of my time. &nbsp;It is a well-written, simple and straightforward guide and well worth a read, especially as it manages to convey a lot of information in a comparably short document (just 17 pages in the <a href="http://www.scrum.org/storage/scrumguides/Scrum_Guide%202011.pdf">English version</a>).  I've just sent it to the rest of the team and heavily suggested that they read it too.</p>
