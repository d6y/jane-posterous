<p>We&rsquo;ve looked at <a href="http://photo.tutsplus.com/articles/quick-tips/quick-tip-never-trust-your-hard-drive/">backup solutions</a> for your photos previously, but I&rsquo;ve recently started exploring the possibility of using <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> as a way to keep images safely stored off-site. In today&rsquo;s Quick Tip I&rsquo;ll be explaining how this works, how much it costs, and how you could retrieve your images if the worst happens!</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>Backing Up To Flickr</h3>
<p>Although the main purpose of Flickr is for <em>sharing</em> your images, the online service will also safely store the original file you upload &ndash; providing you have a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/upgrade/">Pro account</a>. This costs $24.95 for one year, removes any upload or storage limits, and lets you save and access very large resolution files.</p>
<p>If you have a very large photo library, the process of uploading your entire catalog of old images is going to take a very long time. There&rsquo;s no way around this, and it&rsquo;s the cost of using any off-site type of backup system.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are various plugins that can help simplify the process &ndash; whether you use Lightroom, Aperture, or any other application for managing images:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aperture and iPhoto have in-built Flickr integration. Be sure to check the box that asks whether you&rsquo;d like to upload the original resolution file.</li>
<li><a href="http://regex.info/blog/lightroom-goodies/flickr">This plugin</a> is a good solution if you&rsquo;re an Adobe Lightroom user.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can use <a href="http://www.flickr.com/tools/uploadr/">the Flickr Uploadr</a> to upload large batches of files directly from folders in Mac or Windows.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the process of uploading your catalog of photos is too much to bear, consider adding it to your workflow for shoots from now onwards. You can always work backwards at a later date if you decide to.</p>
<h3>Keep Photos Hidden</h3>
<p>Obviously you won&rsquo;t want your whole catalog of photos on display to the world. You can elect to keep them hidden when uploading, and just share those that you&rsquo;re particularly proud of.</p>
<h3>Downloading All Your Images</h3>
<p>If the worst happens and you lose all your local copies (and backups) of your images, it would be a nightmare to go through each image individually on Flickr and download the original. Thankfully, there are various tools that make the restoration process fairly straight-forward:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/flickrbackup/">Flickr Backup</a> &ndash; A free, open source option for downloading all your images.</li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/dan/hivelogic-flickrtouchr">Flickrtouchr</a> &ndash; A command line utility for those who prefer a geeky, technical solution.</li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/onairbustour/wiki/flump">Flump</a> &ndash; A cross-platform, Adobe Air application.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Don&rsquo;t Rely on One Solution</h3>
<p>Although Flickr seems like a very reliable web service, it would be foolish to rely solely on an online system for backup purposes. In all likelihood, your data is far safer on Flickr&rsquo;s servers than it would be locally, but it pays to keep your own backup too.</p>
<p>The beauty with this solution is that it&rsquo;s a very inexpensive way to keep all your photos stored off-site. It removes the headache of rotating hard drives between two locations, and is very cost effective (I imagine many of you already have a Flickr Pro account!)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear what other solutions you use for off-site backup. Feel free to share in the comments!</p>

<p>As I've mentioned <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/backup-strategy-and-workflow">before</a> I've been using <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a> as part of my off-site backup strategy for a couple of years now - if you haven't considered using flickr this way, this article might give you a few tools etc to use to upload, or even download, your images.</p>
