<p>Photo of a page in Edward Tufte's <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=Envisioning%20Information&amp;tag=janedall-21&amp;index=aps&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738">Envisioning Information</a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=janedall-21&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=2" border="0" height="1" alt="" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" /><p /> It was interesting coming across this page in the "Narratives of space and time" chapter as I recognised, with 90% confidence, this as being a diagram of railway connections. Despite not understanding the language of the text I recognise the language of the pattern used to display the data held within it.<p /> This got me to thinking - does this instant recognition mean I take in more information or less? If I was to display other connected data in a similar way would I understand it easier because I recognise the pattern or find it more difficult to comprehend because I expect it to be a different type of data?</p>
