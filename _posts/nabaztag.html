I like the idea of emotional gadgets, things that let you know when other people are thinking about you, or things that are just fun to have around.  The <a href="http://www.nabaztag.com/vl/action/index.do">nabaztag</a> bunny is just such a thing but the Â£72 <a href="http://www.pixmania.co.uk/uk/uk/180596/art/nabaztag/the-first-wireless-rabbit.html">price tag</a> is quite steep for something that is just a cute gadget.  But last weekend I read <a href="http://www.tomhume.org">Tom</a>'s blog and he's found a <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2006/09/nabaztag_open_s.html">business justification</a> for having one.    So, its obviously time to get my thinking cap on and start finding more practical uses for a nabaztag.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-115961074170368732?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
