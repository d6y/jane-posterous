<p>This evening I attended my first <a href="http://asyncjs.com/">Async</a> event at <a href="http://theskiff.org/"> the Skiff</a> (my first visit to the new Skiff too).</p>
<p>I'm not a proficient javascript developer by any means, but it remains one of the areas that I'd always like to know more about. &nbsp;These events seem like a good opportunity to learn from the amassed javascript brains of Brighton.</p>
<p>This evening's event was also interesting as it was an introduction to <a href="http://www.phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a> by <a href="http://mark-kirby.co.uk/">Mark Kirby</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From his <a href="http://mark-kirby.co.uk/2010/phonegap-resources-and-hints/">blog post</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">
<h2>What is PhoneGap?</h2>
<ul>
<li>PhoneGap lets you <em>easily</em> package apps for a range of devices and distribute them on app stores using HTML, CSS and JS</li>
<li>You can still publish apps using HTML, CSS and JS for any of the platforms without PhoneGap, it just saves you time</li>
<li>PhoneGap provides you with JavaScript APIs which talk to device APIs including geolocation, contacts, notifications, accelerometer and more</li>
</ul>

<p>Mark has very kindly produced a lovely <a href="http://mark-kirby.co.uk/2010/phonegap-resources-and-hints/">blog post listing the URLs, demos and other things he referred to during the talk</a>, meaning that for possibly the first talk in a long time, I needed to make no notes in order to benefit.</p>
<p>Async seem to be a welcoming group, and I hope to join them again soon.</p>
