<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">If I&rsquo;m reading a piece of really long fiction, I often find that there are these fabulous things I want to remember. I want to take notes on it, so I highlight it, and if I have a thought about it, I&rsquo;ll type it out quickly. Then I dump all these clippings into a format that I can look at later. In the case of War and Peace, I actually had 16,000 words worth of notes and clippings at the end of it. So I printed it out as a print-on-demand book. In short, I have a physical copy of all of my favorite parts of War and Peace that I can flip through, with my notes, but I don&rsquo;t actually own a physical copy of War and Peace.</blockquote>

<p>Since getting my kindle I have annotated a lot, and wrote an<a href="https://github.com/janedallaway/Kindle-Helper-Scripts"> AppleScript to get my highlights and annotations out of the text file they're stored in, and into a text file per book</a>. These are stored on my Dropbox folder, and I refer to them from time to time. Usually when I want to remember some partially remembered detail. I'm quite taken with the idea of getting them printed out though.</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">But what if your local bookstore, or hell, your local drugstore, had a print-on-demand machine that cost $10,000, and you want the print book, and they say, &ldquo;Oh yeah, come by in three minutes, it&rsquo;ll be ready.&rdquo;</blockquote>
<p>This is exactly what happened at the Lonely Planet shop in Sydney Airport - we bought a custom created guide to Tokyo and had it printed whilst we waited. It wasn't an elaborate print service - it was actually just an A4 laser printer - but it served its purpose well.</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">One of the reasons people like the Kindle is that it&rsquo;s a single-purpose device, so you&rsquo;re not tempted to check your email. I do think the problem of distractions on devices is real &mdash; because they are horribly designed. A desktop environment is just wretched. It&rsquo;s an ergonomic catastrophe. If you look back at the early proponents of ubiquitous computing, they don&rsquo;t talk about staring at one screen &mdash; they talk about screens lying around like papers lying around. And you&rsquo;d use one and throw it away. They&rsquo;d almost be disposable.</blockquote>
<br />The distraction thing is exactly why I like my kindle, as I've mentioned before, I can't be trusted not to get distracted by other things...</div>
