It was quite a packed week, with lots of hints and tips gained as well as an insight into the way we can progress our web products to make the most of the .Net framework.  We even had some spare time to take a look at <a href="http://ajax.asp.net/">ASP.NET Ajax</a> which looks really handy.<p />Some of the most pertinent things to have come out of the course are things like <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307598">session state management</a>, specially with regards to the server farm environment - something we've had a problem with for a while.<p />The best thing for have come out of the course though was probably the opportunity to experiement, to try some things out and to work out how to integrate our learnings into our projects.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-116515968894438101?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
