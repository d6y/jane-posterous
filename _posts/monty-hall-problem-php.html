<p>This evening, after returning from an excellent VBUG: Brighton (of which more in a later post), Richard was talking about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_hall_problem">Monty Hall problem</a> after listening to a discussion about it on the BBC podcast <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/">In Our Time</a>.<p />For those who don't know the Monty Hall problem it is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>A gameshow set has 3 doors.</li>
<li>Behind one of the doors is a prize.</li>
<li>Behind the other 2 doors is nothing.</li>
<li>The contestant choses a door.</li>
<li>The gameshow hosts, knowing where the prize is, and which door the contestant has chosen, opens a door which he knows hasn't got the prize behind it and the contestant hasn't chosen.</li>
<li>The contestant is then offered the opportunity to trade their door for the one remaining door.</li>
</ul>
<p>Should the contestant switch?  The answer is yes 2/3rds of the time.  See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_hall_problem#Solution">here</a> for the reasons.<p />Richard and I both set about proving it in the tools we had available, I chose PHP, Richard chose Scala.  And we both can successfully demonstrate that by always switching doors the contestant is more likely to win.<p />My PHP version is downloadable <a href="http://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B_AkC4ZdTI9tY2Q1M2Y0NjUtYTkwMy00YzIwLWI2YmUtZTU5MjA0ZDNkZGI0&amp;hl=en_GB">here</a>.</p>
