<p>As organiser of <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/madgex-photography-workshop-2">Madgex Photography Workshop #2</a>, I drew the (very) short straw of doing my 8 photos on the final day. &nbsp;So, prior to handing the cameras in to Colourstream, I attempted my 8 shots. &nbsp;As a reminder, the brief was:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>a number</li>
<li>something taken from ground level</li>
<li>a Brighton landmark</li>
<li>something red</li>
<li>a dog</li>
<li>shoes (this one is in tribute to lomokev and his fine collection of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lomokev/sets/75334/" title="shoes and feet">shoes and feet photographs</a>)</li>
<li>street art</li>
<li>the person you're handing the camera over to</li>
</ol>
<p>My attempts were:</p>
<p>A number - actually lots of numbers</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4460056977/" title="Number by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2688/4460056977_c9126f0318_m.jpg" height="240" alt="Number" width="160" /></a></p>
<p>Something taken from ground level - these guys were jumping from surface to surface until I turned up with the camera, then the guy on the right waved at me, so I thought I'd take the photo then</p>

<p>A Brighton landmark - due to limited time I chose the nearest place to my work place, the pavilion...</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4460055673/" title="Brighton Landmark by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2684/4460055673_ba9e7d9003_m.jpg" height="160" alt="Brighton Landmark" width="240" /></a></p>
<p>Something red - probably my favourite of my photos</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4460058923/" title="Red by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4049/4460058923_494fd27459_m.jpg" height="240" alt="Red" width="160" /></a></p>
<p>A dog - not enough time to get home and take a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/tags/skitters/">photo of my lovely dog</a> but I fortunately found one tethered outside a cafe in Bond Street</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4460057829/" title="Dog by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2801/4460057829_479f790b18_m.jpg" height="160" alt="Dog" width="240" /></a></p>
<p>Shoes - I wasn't the only one to take a photo of the display outside this shop</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4460837052/" title="Shoes by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2780/4460837052_f6ae3de7e8_m.jpg" height="160" alt="Shoes" width="240" /></a></p>
<p>Street art</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4460056495/" title="Street Art by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2801/4460056495_d86f8dc72d_m.jpg" height="160" alt="Street Art" width="240" /></a></p>
<p>the person you're handing the camera over to - in my case it wasn't so much a person, as a shop</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janed/4460838134/" title="Person handing the camera over to by Jane Dallaway, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2697/4460838134_05300a8598_m.jpg" height="160" alt="Person handing the camera over to" width="240" /></a></p>
<p>The feedback was generally positive, people had enjoyed the challenge but had found it much more difficult than the last challenge (which allowed the use of any camera, any post processing etc).  At least a couple of people appreciated the fact that it totally levelled the playing field (which was kind of the point).</p>
<p>Some of the participants did really well - quite a few of them got all the photos in order, and some of them managed to get a theme running through them all.  The most impressive theme was books, with each photo representing a different book title - i.e. Catch 22 (for number), Brighton Rock (using the Brighton word lights from the pier (landmark) and a stick of rock) etc.  The winner image(s) from the different themes are now all displayed on the notice board at work for everyone to look at and appreciate.</p>
