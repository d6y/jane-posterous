This evening I helped Nick with <a href="http://www.vbug.co.uk">VBUG</a> Brighton held at <a href="http://www.madgex.com/">Madgex</a>.  Our speaker was <a href="http://serialseb.blogspot.com/">Sebastien Lambla</a> who <blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">runs Caffeine IT, a .net consultancy, helping the good people of London adopt new technologies, new processes, new methodologies and in general anything that's new and shiny</blockquote> speaking about <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/">ASP.NET MVC</a>, test driven development and Ajax with ASP.NET MVC.<p />He gave a brief introduction to MVC within an ASP.NET world before moving on to some demos.  Seb was a great presenter, obviously understood his subject and continued smiling even when his code failed.  He was even prepared enough to pre-post the blog post relating to <a href="http://serialseb.blogspot.com/2008/09/content-of-presentation-at-vbug.html">his talk</a> including a link to the code he was demoing (he promised to tweak it and make it work).<p />We had some new attendees this evening, mainly because it's <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/uk/remix08/agenda.aspx">ReMix</a> tomorrow and Friday and so people who'd arrived early popped along to join us.  Amongst these was <a href="http://www.andrewwestgarth.co.uk/Blog/">Andrew</a>, chairman of VBUG, so it was interesting to find out what his thoughts on all things Microsoft related.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-458862452005772182?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
