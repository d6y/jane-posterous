<a href="http://janeandrichard.co.uk/xmas08/">This year</a> and <a href="http://janeandrichard.co.uk/xmas07/">last</a> we've used some of my photos to create <a href="moo.com/products/greeting_cards.php">moo greetings cards</a> to send to family and friends.  Over summer I started thinking about next year's cards (not that I was organized enough to sort out this years that early, but I had a moment of inspiration) and started planning what I'd need.  My intention is to create a set of photos using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minifigure">lego minifigure</a> santa.  Earlier on this month I braved the <a href="http://shop.lego.com/">lego store</a> to go and see what they had to offer me, and found none.  So, I had to rely on good old ebay.  A couple of weeks ago my <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/janed/sets/72157611165023602/">lego santa</a> arrived, and he's happily been taking part in our Christmas activities and festivities. <p /><b>Firstly he took a look at a Christmas card we'd received</b><br /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<p />I've no doubt that he will be continue to be busy and involved as the festive season continues, but thought his current adventures should be shared.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1557360679092549308-4555597389233784703?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fphotography%2Fphotoblog%2Fphotoblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
