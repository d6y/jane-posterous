<p>In love with Richard Renaldi's photos of strangers touching:<a href="http://bit.ly/aYLx8i" class="tweet-url web" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">http://bit.ly/aYLx8i</a> (via @<a href="http://twitter.com/PhotoJojo" class="tweet-url username" rel="nofollow" style="text-decoration: none; color: #0000ff; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">PhotoJojo</a>)</p>

<p>and as I was sitting at my laptop I followed the link and wow, I agree with his sentiments</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.renaldi.com/photographs/touching/index.html">Touching Strangers</a> work is simply getting two or more strangers to each other, and to the photographer, to pose for a portrait where they are touching in some way or another.  There are some amazing images to be seen amongst the 35 that are currently on display.  I'd love to see these in real life in a gallery somewhere, preferably without having to travel to the <a href="http://www.fondationdentreprisehermes.org/eng-GB/axe/94/Creativity.htm">Hermès Foundation in New York</a>.</p>
