<p>Here’s a fun concept design imagining the classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodak_Brownie">Kodak Brownie</a> reintroduced to for the 2012 London Olympic games as a simple digital camera. Designer <a href="http://www.coroflot.com/public/individual_file.asp?from_url=true&amp;individual_id=322860&amp;portfolio_id=3534993&amp;">James Coleman</a> says,</p>
<blockquote><p>After researching the history of the Brownie I realised that Kodak often made special edition Brownies for major events such as World Fairs or anniversaries. Being from London, I chose to design a Brownie for the upcoming 2012 Olympic games.</p></blockquote>
<p>The only control on the camera is the shutter button, and it has three lenses — two for the viewfinders and one for the actual exposure. Rather than looking at an LCD screen or pressing a viewfinder to your face, you gaze into one of the two viewfinders from above depending on whether you’re shooting a landscape or portrait image.</p>
<p>What do you think of this design? Would you enjoy it as a novel “toy” digital camera?</p>

    <p>So cute!  I have 2 original film box cameras in my cupboard, both of which need to get out and about over summer.  I love the idea of this, and depending on price would probably end up with one in my <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/tag/kitbag">kit bag</a></p></div>
