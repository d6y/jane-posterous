<p>Following on from my post the other week about <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/photographs-that-changed-the-world-0">Photographs that changed the world</a>, a <a href="http://twitter.com/petapixel/">petapixel tweet</a> yesterday made me aware that the nurse featured in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%E2%80%93J_day_in_Times_Square">V-J Day in Times Square</a>, one<span style="color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;"><strong> </strong></span></span>of the photos on the <a href="http://www.neatorama.com/2007/01/02/13-photographs-that-changed-the-world/#">13 photographs that changed the world</a> article, had <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/37863636/ns/us_news-life/">died at age 91 at he home in LA</a>.</p>
<p>The Alfred Eisentstaedt photograph is copyrighted and is now the property of the Getty Museum, so I'll have to make do with posting a photograph taking at the same time by US Navy photo journalist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Jorgensen">Victor Jorgensen</a> which is entitled "Kissing the war goodbye".</p>
<p><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Kissing_the_War_Goodbye.jpg"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Kissing_the_War_Goodbye.jpg/568px-Kissing_the_War_Goodbye.jpg" height="600" alt="File:Kissing the War Goodbye.jpg" width="568" /></a></p>
<p>The people featured in this iconic photograph weren't known at the time - it wasn't until 1970 that Edith Shain, the lady who has just died, wrote to the photographer, Alfred Eisentstaedt, and claimed to be the nurse.</p>
<p>A quick <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=eisenstaedt%20kiss&amp;w=all">search on flickr</a> shows just how many people have re-enacted this image.</p>
