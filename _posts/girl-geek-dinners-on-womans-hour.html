Thanks to Val's post to the Brighton Girl Geek Dinners mailing list, I've just listened to the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/04/2007_25_fri.shtml?rss">Girl Geek Dinner section of Woman's Hour</a> from last week.  Great to hear the Girlie Geeks getting such positive coverage.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14400377-3917596664207064505?l=jane.dallaway.com%2Fblog%2Fblog.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
