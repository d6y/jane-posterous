    <p>I've taken part in a few of these kind of projects, where you have one day to take a photograph, be it for <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/worldtoycameradayand_then_some/">World Toy Camera day</a> (which interestingly is 2 days this year - the 9th and 10th of October), or whatever.  Rarely, though, have I known about them more than a day or two ahead of time.  I can't decide whether having a full month to think about ideas makes it harder or easier, or more likely that I will end up liking what I choose to submit.  My current thought is to use it as part of my <a href="http://janeonthemove.posterous.com/tag/365">365</a> <a href="http://janeonthemove.posterous.com/pages/projects-57">project</a>, although that does limit me to only being able to shoot using the iPhone4 (as that is my personal 365 restriction).  The crossover with the World Toy Camera day makes it have other potential as well though.</p><p><a href="http://www.hchamp.com/101010/"><img src="http://www.hchamp.com/101010/img/101010.png" alt="October 10th, A most auspicious day" /></a></p></div>
