<p>As an adult you&rsquo;re responsible for your own education. If you find it deficient in some area, educate yourself into proficiency.</p>
<p>Many people find their early education lacking when they reach adulthood. No one really knows what knowledge and skills will be important to you later in life. So they guess and they often guess wrong.</p>

<p>You may feel deficient in some areas. That&rsquo;s normal. If you feel your schooling didn&rsquo;t do a very good job, that&rsquo;s a shame, but it is what it is.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know how, learn how. Use that fancy brain that learned how to walk, talk, and read. It&rsquo;s still capable of further learning, is it not? Of course it is!</p>

<p>Learning is a habit. It's easy to get into a mindset where learning just seems to hard. Technology changes quickly. As a developer, or even just a consumer of technology, adaption is the key. Embrace the ability to learn new things. Sure, learning new things can be difficult, but also so rewarding. The human brain is a wonderful thing. Exploit it. Flex it. Make it work for you.</p>
<p>Also the bit about "Much of the technology I use today didn't exist when I was in school" reminded me of <a href="http://jane.dallaway.com/article-career-plans-are-dangerous">this</a>.</p>
